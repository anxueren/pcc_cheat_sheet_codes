      "tanned his light shoulders by the banks of the river when bathing,\n",
      "performing the sacred ablutions, the sacred offerings.  In the mango\n",
      "grove, shade poured into his black eyes, when playing as a boy, when\n",
      "his mother sang, when the sacred offerings were made, when his father,\n",
      "the scholar, taught him, when the wise men talked.  For a long time,\n",
      "Siddhartha had been partaking in the discussions of the wise men,\n",
      "practising debate with Govinda, practising with Govinda the art of\n",
      "reflection, the service of meditation.  He already knew how to speak the\n",
      "Om silently, the word of words, to speak it silently into himself while\n",
      "inhaling, to speak it silently out of himself while exhaling, with all\n",
      "the concentration of his soul, the forehead surrounded by the glow of\n",
      "the clear-thinking spirit.  He already knew to feel Atman in the depths\n",
      "of his being, indestructible, one with the universe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Joy leapt in his father's heart for his son who was quick to learn,\n",
      "thirsty for knowledge; he saw him growing up to become great wise man\n",
      "and priest, a prince among the Brahmans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bliss leapt in his mother's breast when she saw him, when she saw him\n",
      "walking, when she saw him sit down and get up, Siddhartha, strong,\n",
      "handsome, he who was walking on slender legs, greeting her with perfect\n",
      "respect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love touched the hearts of the Brahmans' young daughters when\n",
      "Siddhartha walked through the lanes of the town with the luminous\n",

      "\n",
      "But more than all the others he was loved by Govinda, his friend, the\n",
      "son of a Brahman.  He loved Siddhartha's eye and sweet voice, he loved\n",
      "his walk and the perfect decency of his movements, he loved everything\n",
      "Siddhartha did and said and what he loved most was his spirit, his\n",
      "transcendent, fiery thoughts, his ardent will, his high calling.\n",
      "Govinda knew: he would not become a common Brahman, not a lazy official\n",
      "in charge of offerings; not a greedy merchant with magic spells; not a\n",
      "vain, vacuous speaker; not a mean, deceitful priest; and also not a\n",
      "decent, stupid sheep in the herd of the many.  No, and he, Govinda, as\n",
      "well did not want to become one of those, not one of those tens of\n",
      "thousands of Brahmans.  He wanted to follow Siddhartha, the beloved,\n",
      "the splendid.  And in days to come, when Siddhartha would become a god,\n",
      "when he would join the glorious, then Govinda wanted to follow him as\n",
      "his friend, his companion, his servant, his spear-carrier, his shadow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha was thus loved by everyone.  He was a source of joy for\n",
      "everybody, he was a delight for them all.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he, Siddhartha, was not a source of joy for himself, he found no\n",
      "delight in himself.  Walking the rosy paths of the fig tree garden,\n",
      "sitting in the bluish shade of the grove of contemplation, washing his\n",
      "limbs daily in the bath of repentance, sacrificing in the dim shade of\n",
      "the mango forest, his gestures of perfect decency, everyone's love and\n",
      "joy, he still lacked all joy in his heart.  Dreams and restless thoughts\n",
      "came into his mind, flowing from the water of the river, sparkling from\n",
      "the stars of the night, melting from the beams of the sun, dreams came\n",
      "to him and a restlessness of the soul, fuming from the sacrifices,\n",
      "breathing forth from the verses of the Rig-Veda, being infused into him,\n",
      "drop by drop, from the teachings of the old Brahmans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha had started to nurse discontent in himself, he had started\n",
      "to feel that the love of his father and the love of his mother, and also\n",
      "the love of his friend, Govinda, would not bring him joy for ever and\n",
      "ever, would not nurse him, feed him, satisfy him.  He had started to\n",
      "suspect that his venerable father and his other teachers, that the wise\n",
      "Brahmans had already revealed to him the most and best of their wisdom,\n",
      "that they had already filled his expecting vessel with their richness,\n",
      "and the vessel was not full, the spirit was not content, the soul was\n",
      "not calm, the heart was not satisfied.  The ablutions were good, but\n",
      "they were water, they did not wash off the sin, they did not heal the\n",
      "spirit's thirst, they did not relieve the fear in his heart.  The\n",
      "sacrifices and the invocation of the gods were excellent--but was that\n",
      "all?  Did the sacrifices give a happy fortune?  And what about the gods?\n",
      "Was it really Prajapati who had created the world?  Was it not the\n",
      "Atman, He, the only one, the singular one?  Were the gods not creations,\n",
      "created like me and you, subject to time, mortal?  Was it therefore\n",
      "good, was it right, was it meaningful and the highest occupation to make\n",
      "offerings to the gods?  For whom else were offerings to be made, who\n",
      "else was to be worshipped but Him, the only one, the Atman?  And where\n",
      "was Atman to be found, where did He reside, where did his eternal heart\n",
      "beat, where else but in one's own self, in its innermost part, in its\n",
      "indestructible part, which everyone had in himself?  But where, where\n",
      "was this self, this innermost part, this ultimate part?  It was not\n",
      "flesh and bone, it was neither thought nor consciousness, thus the\n",
      "wisest ones taught.  So, where, where was it?  To reach this place, the\n",
      "self, myself, the Atman, there was another way, which was worthwhile\n",
      "looking for?  Alas, and nobody showed this way, nobody knew it, not the\n",
      "father, and not the teachers and wise men, not the holy sacrificial\n",
      "songs!  They knew everything, the Brahmans and their holy books, they\n",
      "knew everything, they had taken care of everything and of more than\n",
      "everything, the creation of the world, the origin of speech, of food, of\n",
      "inhaling, of exhaling, the arrangement of the senses, the acts of the\n",
      "gods, they knew infinitely much--but was it valuable to know all of\n",
      "this, not knowing that one and only thing, the most important thing, the\n",
      "solely important thing?\n",
      "\n",
      "Surely, many verses of the holy books, particularly in the Upanishades\n",
      "of Samaveda, spoke of this innermost and ultimate thing, wonderful\n",
      "verses.  \"Your soul is the whole world\", was written there, and it was\n",
      "written that man in his sleep, in his deep sleep, would meet with his\n",
      "innermost part and would reside in the Atman.  Marvellous wisdom was in\n",
      "these verses, all knowledge of the wisest ones had been collected here\n",
      "in magic words, pure as honey collected by bees.  No, not to be looked\n",
      "down upon was the tremendous amount of enlightenment which lay here\n",
      "collected and preserved by innumerable generations of wise Brahmans.--\n",
      "But where were the Brahmans, where the priests, where the wise men or\n",
      "penitents, who had succeeded in not just knowing this deepest of all\n",
      "knowledge but also to live it?  Where was the knowledgeable one who wove\n",
      "his spell to bring his familiarity with the Atman out of the sleep into\n",
      "the state of being awake, into the life, into every step of the way,\n",
      "into word and deed?  Siddhartha knew many venerable Brahmans, chiefly\n",
      "his father, the pure one, the scholar, the most venerable one.  His\n",
      "father was to be admired, quiet and noble were his manners, pure his\n",
      "life, wise his words, delicate and noble thoughts lived behind its brow\n",
      "--but even he, who knew so much, did he live in blissfulness, did he\n",
      "have peace, was he not also just a searching man, a thirsty man?  Did he\n",
      "not, again and again, have to drink from holy sources, as a thirsty man,\n",
      "from the offerings, from the books, from the disputes of the Brahmans?\n",
      "Why did he, the irreproachable one, have to wash off sins every day,\n",
      "strive for a cleansing every day, over and over every day?  Was not\n",
      "Atman in him, did not the pristine source spring from his heart?  It had\n",
      "to be found, the pristine source in one's own self, it had to be\n",
      "possessed!  Everything else was searching, was a detour, was getting\n",
      "lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus were Siddhartha's thoughts, this was his thirst, this was his\n",
      "suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often he spoke to himself from a Chandogya-Upanishad the words:\n",
      "\"Truly, the name of the Brahman is satyam--verily, he who knows such a\n",
      "thing, will enter the heavenly world every day.\"  Often, it seemed near,\n",
      "the heavenly world, but never he had reached it completely, never he had\n",
      "quenched the ultimate thirst.  And among all the wise and wisest men, he\n",
      "knew and whose instructions he had received, among all of them there was\n",
      "no one, who had reached it completely, the heavenly world, who had\n",
      "quenched it completely, the eternal thirst.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Govinda,\" Siddhartha spoke to his friend, \"Govinda, my dear, come with\n",
      "me under the Banyan tree, let's practise meditation.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They went to the Banyan tree, they sat down, Siddhartha right here,\n",
      "Govinda twenty paces away.  While putting himself down, ready to speak\n",
      "the Om, Siddhartha repeated murmuring the verse:\n",
      "\n",
      "Om is the bow, the arrow is soul,\n",
      "The Brahman is the arrow's target,\n",
      "That one should incessantly hit.\n",
      "\n",
      "After the usual time of the exercise in meditation had passed, Govinda\n",
      "rose.  The evening had come, it was time to perform the evening's ablution.\n",
      "He called Siddhartha's name.  Siddhartha did not answer.  Siddhartha sat\n",
      "there lost in thought, his eyes were rigidly focused towards a very\n",
      "distant target, the tip of his tongue was protruding a little between\n",
      "the teeth, he seemed not to breathe.  Thus sat he, wrapped up in\n",
      "contemplation, thinking Om, his soul sent after the Brahman as an arrow.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once, Samanas had travelled through Siddhartha's town, ascetics on a\n",
      "pilgrimage, three skinny, withered men, neither old nor young, with\n",
      "dusty and bloody shoulders, almost naked, scorched by the sun,\n",
      "surrounded by loneliness, strangers and enemies to the world, strangers\n",
      "and lank jackals in the realm of humans.  Behind them blew a hot scent\n",
      "of quiet passion, of destructive service, of merciless self-denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the evening, after the hour of contemplation, Siddhartha spoke to\n",
      "Govinda:  \"Early tomorrow morning, my friend, Siddhartha will go to the\n",
      "Samanas.  He will become a Samana.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Govinda turned pale, when he heard these words and read the decision in\n",
      "the motionless face of his friend, unstoppable like the arrow shot from\n",
      "the bow.  Soon and with the first glance, Govinda realized:  Now it is\n",
      "beginning, now Siddhartha is taking his own way, now his fate is\n",
      "beginning to sprout, and with his, my own.  And he turned pale like a\n",
      "dry banana-skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O Siddhartha,\" he exclaimed, \"will your father permit you to do that?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha looked over as if he was just waking up.  Arrow-fast he read\n",
      "in Govinda's soul, read the fear, read the submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"O Govinda,\" he spoke quietly, \"let's not waste words.  Tomorrow, at\n",
      "daybreak I will begin the life of the Samanas.  Speak no more of it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha entered the chamber, where his father was sitting on a mat of\n",
      "bast, and stepped behind his father and remained standing there, until\n",
      "his father felt that someone was standing behind him.  Quoth the\n",
      "Brahman:  \"Is that you, Siddhartha?  Then say what you came to say.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha: \"With your permission, my father.  I came to tell you\n",
      "that it is my longing to leave your house tomorrow and go to the\n",
      "ascetics.  My desire is to become a Samana.  May my father not oppose\n",
      "this.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Brahman fell silent, and remained silent for so long that the stars\n",
      "in the small window wandered and changed their relative positions, 'ere\n",
      "the silence was broken.  Silent and motionless stood the son with his\n",
      "arms folded, silent and motionless sat the father on the mat, and the\n",
      "stars traced their paths in the sky.  Then spoke the father:  \"Not\n",
      "proper it is for a Brahman to speak harsh and angry words.  But\n",
      "indignation is in my heart.  I wish not to hear this request for a\n",
      "second time from your mouth.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly, the Brahman rose; Siddhartha stood silently, his arms folded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What are you waiting for?\" asked the father.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha:  \"You know what.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indignant, the father left the chamber; indignant, he went to his bed\n",
      "and lay down.\n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour, since no sleep had come over his eyes, the Brahman stood\n",
      "up, paced to and fro, and left the house.  Through the small window of\n",
      "the chamber he looked back inside, and there he saw Siddhartha standing,\n",
      "his arms folded, not moving from his spot.  Pale shimmered his bright\n",
      "robe.  With anxiety in his heart, the father returned to his bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "After another hour, since no sleep had come over his eyes, the Brahman\n",
      "stood up again, paced to and fro, walked out of the house and saw that\n",
      "the moon had risen.  Through the window of the chamber he looked back\n",
      "inside; there stood Siddhartha, not moving from his spot, his arms\n",
      "folded, moonlight reflecting from his bare shins.  With worry in his\n",
      "heart, the father went back to bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "And he came back after an hour, he came back after two hours, looked\n",
      "through the small window, saw Siddhartha standing, in the moon light,\n",
      "by the light of the stars, in the darkness.  And he came back hour after\n",
      "hour, silently, he looked into the chamber, saw him standing in the same\n",
      "place, filled his heart with anger, filled his heart with unrest, filled\n",
      "his heart with anguish, filled it with sadness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And in the night's last hour, before the day began, he returned, stepped\n",
      "into the room, saw the young man standing there, who seemed tall and\n",
      "like a stranger to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Siddhartha,\" he spoke, \"what are you waiting for?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know what.\"\n",

      "Siddhartha was trembling softly in his knees.  In Siddhartha's face he\n",
      "saw no trembling, his eyes were fixed on a distant spot.  Then his\n",

      "\n",
      "The Father touched Siddhartha's shoulder.\n",

      "\n",
      "He took his hand from the shoulder of his son and went outside.\n",

      "back under control, bowed to his father, and went to his mother to do as\n",
      "his father had said.\n",
      "\n",
      "As he slowly left on stiff legs in the first light of day the still\n",

      "In the evening of this day they caught up with the ascetics, the skinny\n",
      "Samanas, and offered them their companionship and--obedience.  They\n",
      "were accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha gave his garments to a poor Brahman in the street.  He wore\n",
      "nothing more than the loincloth and the earth-coloured, unsown cloak.\n",
      "He ate only once a day, and never something cooked.  He fasted for\n",
      "fifteen days.  He fasted for twenty-eight days.  The flesh waned from\n",
      "his thighs and cheeks.  Feverish dreams flickered from his enlarged\n",
      "eyes, long nails grew slowly on his parched fingers and a dry, shaggy\n",
      "beard grew on his chin.  His glance turned to ice when he encountered\n",
      "women; his mouth twitched with contempt, when he walked through a city\n",
      "of nicely dressed people.  He saw merchants trading, princes hunting,\n",
      "mourners wailing for their dead, whores offering themselves, physicians\n",
      "trying to help the sick, priests determining the most suitable day for\n",
      "seeding, lovers loving, mothers nursing their children--and all of this\n",
      "was not worthy of one look from his eye, it all lied, it all stank,\n",
      "it all stank of lies, it all pretended to be meaningful and joyful and\n",
      "beautiful, and it all was just concealed putrefaction.  The world tasted\n",
      "bitter.  Life was torture.\n",
      "\n",
      "A goal stood before Siddhartha, a single goal: to become empty, empty of\n",

      "Dead to himself, not to be a self any more, to find tranquility with an\n",
      "emptied heard, to be open to miracles in unselfish thoughts, that was\n",
      "his goal.  Once all of my self was overcome and had died, once every\n",
      "desire and every urge was silent in the heart, then the ultimate part\n",

      "from Gotama's community were on their way to the Jetavana.  And since\n",
      "they reached it at night, there were constant arrivals, shouts, and\n",
      "talk of those who sought shelter and got it.  The two Samanas,\n",
      "accustomed to life in the forest, found quickly and without making any\n",
      "noise a place to stay and rested there until the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunrise, they saw with astonishment what a large crowd of believers\n",
      "and curious people had spent the night here.  On all paths of the\n",
      "marvellous grove, monks walked in yellow robes, under the trees they\n",
      "sat here and there, in deep contemplation--or in a conversation about\n",
      "spiritual matters, the shady gardens looked like a city, full of people,\n",
      "bustling like bees.  The majority of the monks went out with their\n",
      "alms-dish, to collect food in town for their lunch, the only meal of the\n",
      "day.  The Buddha himself, the enlightened one, was also in the habit of\n",
      "taking this walk to beg in the morning.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha saw him, and he instantly recognised him, as if a god had\n",
      "pointed him out to him.  He saw him, a simple man in a yellow robe,\n",
      "bearing the alms-dish in his hand, walking silently.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Look here!\" Siddhartha said quietly to Govinda.  \"This one is the\n",
      "Buddha.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Attentively, Govinda looked at the monk in the yellow robe, who seemed\n",
      "to be in no way different from the hundreds of other monks.  And soon,\n",
      "Govinda also realized:  This is the one.  And they followed him and\n",
      "observed him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddha went on his way, modestly and deep in his thoughts, his\n",
      "calm face was neither happy nor sad, it seemed to smile quietly and\n",
      "inwardly.  With a hidden smile, quiet, calm, somewhat resembling a\n",
      "healthy child, the Buddha walked, wore the robe and placed his feet\n",
      "just as all of his monks did, according to a precise rule.  But his\n",
      "face and his walk, his quietly lowered glance, his quietly dangling hand\n",
      "and even every finger of his quietly dangling hand expressed peace,\n",
      "expressed perfection, did not search, did not imitate, breathed softly\n",
      "in an unwhithering calm, in an unwhithering light, an untouchable peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus Gotama walked towards the town, to collect alms, and the two\n",
      "Samanas recognised him solely by the perfection of his calm, by the\n",
      "quietness of his appearance, in which there was no searching, no desire,\n",
      "no imitation, no effort to be seen, only light and peace.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Today, we'll hear the teachings from his mouth.\" said Govinda.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha did not answer.  He felt little curiosity for the teachings,\n",
      "he did not believe that they would teach him anything new, but he had,\n",
      "just as Govinda had, heard the contents of this Buddha's teachings\n",
      "again and again, though these reports only represented second- or\n",
      "third-hand information.  But attentively he looked at Gotama's head,\n",
      "his shoulders, his feet, his quietly dangling hand, and it seemed to\n",
      "him as if every joint of every finger of this hand was of these\n",
      "teachings, spoke of, breathed of, exhaled the fragrant of, glistened of\n",
      "truth.  This man, this Buddha was truthful down to the gesture of his\n",
      "last finger.  This man was holy.  Never before, Siddhartha had venerated\n",
      "a person so much, never before he had loved a person as much as this\n",
      "one.\n",
      "\n",
      "They both followed the Buddha until they reached the town and then\n",
      "returned in silence, for they themselves intended to abstain from\n",
      "on this day.  They saw Gotama returning--what he ate could not even have\n",
      "satisfied a bird's appetite, and they saw him retiring into the shade\n",
      "of the mango-trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the evening, when the heat cooled down and everyone in the camp\n",
      "started to bustle about and gathered around, they heard the Buddha\n",
      "teaching.  They heard his voice, and it was also perfected, was of\n",
      "perfect calmness, was full of peace.  Gotama taught the teachings of\n",
      "suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the way to relieve suffering.\n",
      "Calmly and clearly his quiet speech flowed on.  Suffering was life,\n",
      "full of suffering was the world, but salvation from suffering had been\n",
      "found:  salvation was obtained by him who would walk the path of the\n",
      "Buddha.  With a soft, yet firm voice the exalted one spoke, taught the\n",
      "four main doctrines, taught the eightfold path, patiently he went the\n",
      "usual path of the teachings, of the examples, of the repetitions,\n",
      "brightly and quietly his voice hovered over the listeners, like a light,\n",
      "like a starry sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the Buddha--night had already fallen--ended his speech, many a\n",
      "pilgrim stepped forward and asked to accepted into the community, sought\n",
      "refuge in the teachings.  And Gotama accepted them by speaking:  \"You\n",
      "have heard the teachings well, it has come to you well.  Thus join us\n",
      "and walk in holiness, to put an end to all suffering.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Behold, then Govinda, the shy one, also stepped forward and spoke:  \"I\n",
      "also take my refuge in the exalted one and his teachings,\" and he asked\n",
      "to accepted into the community of his disciples and was accepted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Right afterwards, when the Buddha had retired for the night, Govinda\n",
      "turned to Siddhartha and spoke eagerly:  \"Siddhartha, it is not my place\n",
      "to scold you.  We have both heard the exalted one, we have both\n",
      "perceived the teachings.  Govinda has heard the teachings, he has taken\n",
      "refuge in it.  But you, my honoured friend, don't you also want to walk\n",
      "the path of salvation?  Would you want to hesitate, do you want to wait\n",
      "any longer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha awakened as if he had been asleep, when he heard Govinda's\n",
      "words.  For a long time, he looked into Govinda's face.  Then he spoke\n",
      "quietly, in a voice without mockery:  \"Govinda, my friend, now you have\n",
      "taken this step, now you have chosen this path.  Always, oh Govinda,\n",
      "you've been my friend, you've always walked one step behind me.  Often I\n",
      "have thought:  Won't Govinda for once also take a step by himself,\n",
      "without me, out of his own soul?  Behold, now you've turned into a man\n",
      "and are choosing your path for yourself.  I wish that you would go it up\n",
      "to its end, oh my friend, that you shall find salvation!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Govinda, not completely understanding it yet, repeated his question in\n",
      "an impatient tone:  \"Speak up, I beg you, my dear!  Tell me, since it\n",
      "could not be any other way, that you also, my learned friend, will take\n",
      "your refuge with the exalted Buddha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha placed his hand on Govinda's shoulder:  \"You failed to hear\n",
      "my good wish for you, oh Govinda.  I'm repeating it:  I wish that you\n",
      "would go this path up to its end, that you shall find salvation!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "In this moment, Govinda realized that his friend had left him, and he\n",
      "started to weep.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Siddhartha!\" he exclaimed lamentingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha kindly spoke to him:  \"Don't forget, Govinda, that you are\n",
      "now one of the Samanas of the Buddha!  You have renounced your home\n",
      "and your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced your\n",
      "free will, renounced all friendship.  This is what the teachings\n",
      "require, this is what the exalted one wants.  This is what you wanted\n",
      "for yourself.  Tomorrow, oh Govinda, I'll leave you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, the friends continued walking in the grove; for a long\n",
      "time, they lay there and found no sleep.  And over and over again,\n",
      "Govinda urged his friend, he should tell him why he would not want to\n",
      "seek refuge in Gotama's teachings, what fault he would find in these\n",
      "teachings.  But Siddhartha turned him away every time and said:  \"Be\n",
      "content, Govinda!  Very good are the teachings of the exalted one, how\n",
      "could I find a fault in them?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Very early in the morning, a follower of Buddha, one of his oldest\n",
      "monks, went through the garden and called all those to him who had as\n",
      "novices taken their refuge in the teachings, to dress them up in the\n",
      "yellow robe and to instruct them in the first teachings and duties of\n",
      "their position.  Then Govinda broke loose, embraced once again his\n",
      "childhood friend and left with the novices.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Siddhartha walked through the grove, lost in thought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he happened to meet Gotama, the exalted one, and when he greeted\n",
      "him with respect and the Buddha's glance was so full of kindness and\n",
      "calm, the young man summoned his courage and asked the venerable one for\n",
      "the permission to talk to him.  Silently the exalted one nodded his\n",
      "approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha:  \"Yesterday, oh exalted one, I had been privileged to\n",

      "afar, to hear your teachings.  And now my friend is going to stay with\n",
      "your people, he has taken his refuge with you.  But I will again start\n",
      "on my pilgrimage.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As you please,\" the venerable one spoke politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Too bold is my speech,\" Siddhartha continued, \"but I do not want to\n",

      "Does it please the venerable one to listen to me for one moment longer?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Silently, the Buddha nodded his approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha:  \"One thing, oh most venerable one, I have admired in\n",
      "your teachings most of all.  Everything in your teachings is perfectly\n",
      "clear, is proven; you are presenting the world as a perfect chain, a\n",
      "chain which is never and nowhere broken, an eternal chain the links of\n",
      "which are causes and effects.  Never before, this has been seen so\n",
      "clearly; never before, this has been presented so irrefutably; truly,\n",
      "the heart of every Brahman has to beat stronger with love, once he has\n",
      "seen the world through your teachings perfectly connected, without gaps,\n",
      "clear as a crystal, not depending on chance, not depending on gods.\n",
      "Whether it may be good or bad, whether living according to it would be\n",
      "suffering or joy, I do not wish to discuss, possibly this is not\n",
      "essential--but the uniformity of the world, that everything which\n",
      "happens is connected, that the great and the small things are all\n",
      "encompassed by the same forces of time, by the same law of causes, of\n",
      "coming into being and of dying, this is what shines brightly out of your\n",
      "exalted teachings, oh perfected one.  But according to your very own\n",
      "teachings, this unity and necessary sequence of all things is\n",
      "nevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of\n",
      "unity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had\n",
      "not been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be\n",
      "proven: these are your teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation.\n",
      "But with this small gap, with this small breach, the entire eternal and\n",
      "uniform law of the world is breaking apart again and becomes void.\n",
      "Please forgive me for expressing this objection.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quietly, Gotama had listened to him, unmoved.  Now he spoke, the\n",
      "perfected one, with his kind, with his polite and clear voice:  \"You've\n",
      "heard the teachings, oh son of a Brahman, and good for you that you've\n",
      "thought about it thus deeply.  You've found a gap in it, an error.  You\n",
      "should think about this further.  But be warned, oh seeker of knowledge,\n",
      "of the thicket of opinions and of arguing about words.  There is nothing\n",
      "to opinions, they may be beautiful or ugly, smart or foolish, everyone\n",
      "can support them or discard them.  But the teachings, you've heard from\n",
      "me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those\n",
      "who seek knowledge.  They have a different goal; their goal is salvation\n",
      "from suffering.  This is what Gotama teaches, nothing else.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish that you, oh exalted one, would not be angry with me,\" said the\n",
      "young man.  \"I have not spoken to you like this to argue with you, to\n",
      "argue about words.  You are truly right, there is little to opinions.\n",
      "But let me say this one more thing:  I have not doubted in you for a\n",
      "single moment.  I have not doubted for a single moment that you are\n",
      "Buddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest goal towards which\n",
      "so many thousands of Brahmans and sons of Brahmans are on their way.\n",
      "You have found salvation from death.  It has come to you in the course\n",
      "of your own search, on your own path, through thoughts, through\n",
      "meditation, through realizations, through enlightenment.  It has not\n",
      "come to you by means of teachings!  And--thus is my thought, oh exalted\n",
      "one,--nobody will obtain salvation by means of teachings!  You will not\n",
      "be able to convey and say to anybody, oh venerable one, in words and\n",
      "through teachings what has happened to you in the hour of enlightenment!\n",
      "The teachings of the enlightened Buddha contain much, it teaches many to\n",
      "live righteously, to avoid evil.  But there is one thing which these so\n",
      "clear, these so venerable teachings do not contain:  they do not contain\n",
      "the mystery of what the exalted one has experienced for himself, he\n",
      "alone among hundreds of thousands.  This is what I have thought and\n",
      "realized, when I have heard the teachings.  This is why I am continuing\n",
      "my travels--not to seek other, better teachings, for I know there are\n",
      "none, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my\n",
      "goal by myself or to die.  But often, I'll think of this day, oh exalted\n",
      "one, and of this hour, when my eyes beheld a holy man.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddha's eyes quietly looked to the ground; quietly, in perfect\n",
      "equanimity his inscrutable face was smiling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I wish,\" the venerable one spoke slowly, \"that your thoughts shall not\n",
      "be in error, that you shall reach the goal!  But tell me:  Have you seen\n",
      "the multitude of my Samanas, my many brothers, who have taken refuge in\n",
      "the teachings?  And do you believe, oh stranger, oh Samana, do you\n",
      "believe that it would be better for them all the abandon the teachings\n",
      "and to return into the life the world and of desires?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Far is such a thought from my mind,\" exclaimed Siddhartha.  \"I wish\n",
      "that they shall all stay with the teachings, that they shall reach their\n",
      "goal!  It is not my place to judge another person's life.  Only for\n",
      "myself, for myself alone, I must decide, I must chose, I must refuse.\n",
      "Salvation from the self is what we Samanas search for, oh exalted one.\n",
      "If I merely were one of your disciples, oh venerable one, I'd fear that\n",
      "it might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self\n",
      "would be calm and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and\n",
      "grow, for then I had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to\n",
      "follow you, my love for you, and the community of the monks!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With half of a smile, with an unwavering openness and kindness,\n",
      "Gotama looked into the stranger's eyes and bid him to leave with a\n",
      "hardly noticeable gesture.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You are wise, oh Samana.\", the venerable one spoke.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You know how to talk wisely, my friend.  Be aware of too much wisdom!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The Buddha turned away, and his glance and half of a smile remained\n",
      "forever etched in Siddhartha's memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have never before seen a person glance and smile, sit and walk this\n",
      "way, he thought; truly, I wish to be able to glance and smile, sit and\n",
      "walk this way, too, thus free, thus venerable, thus concealed, thus\n",
      "open, thus child-like and mysterious.  Truly, only a person who has\n",
      "succeeded in reaching the innermost part of his self would glance and\n",
      "walk this way.  Well so, I also will seek to reach the innermost part\n",
      "of my self.\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw a man, Siddhartha thought, a single man, before whom I would have\n",
      "to lower my glance.  I do not want to lower my glance before any other,\n",
      "not before any other.  No teachings will entice me any more, since this\n",
      "man's teachings have not enticed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am deprived by the Buddha, thought Siddhartha, I am deprived, and\n",
      "even more he has given to me.  He has deprived me of my friend, the one\n",
      "who had believed in me and now believes in him, who had been my shadow\n",
      "and is now Gotama's shadow.  But he has given me Siddhartha, myself.\n",

      "AWAKENING\n",
      "\n",
      "When Siddhartha left the grove, where the Buddha, the perfected one,\n",
      "stayed behind, where Govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this\n",
      "grove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him.  He pondered\n",
      "about this sensation, which filled him completely, as he was slowly\n",
      "walking along.  He pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he\n",
      "let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place\n",
      "where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to\n",
      "him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn\n",
      "into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to\n",
      "emit like rays of light what is inside of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly walking along, Siddhartha pondered.  He realized that he was no\n",
      "youth any more, but had turned into a man.  He realized that one thing\n",
      "had left him, as a snake is left by its old skin, that one thing no\n",
      "longer existed in him, which had accompanied him throughout his youth\n",
      "and used to be a part of him: the wish to have teachers and to listen to\n",
      "teachings.  He had also left the last teacher who had appeared on his\n",
      "path, even him, the highest and wisest teacher, the most holy one,\n",
      "Buddha, he had left him, had to part with him, was not able to accept\n",
      "his teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slower, he walked along in his thoughts and asked himself:  \"But what\n",
      "is this, what you have sought to learn from teachings and from teachers,\n",
      "and what they, who have taught you much, were still unable to teach\n",
      "you?\"  And he found:  \"It was the self, the purpose and essence of which\n",
      "I sought to learn.  It was the self, I wanted to free myself from, which\n",
      "I sought to overcome.  But I was not able to overcome it, could only\n",
      "deceive it, could only flee from it, only hide from it.  Truly, no\n",
      "thing in this world has kept my thoughts thus busy, as this my very own\n",
      "self, this mystery of me being alive, of me being one and being\n",
      "separated and isolated from all others, of me being Siddhartha!  And\n",
      "there is no thing in this world I know less about than about me, about\n",
      "Siddhartha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been pondering while slowly walking along, he now stopped as\n",
      "these thoughts caught hold of him, and right away another thought sprang\n",
      "forth from these, a new thought, which was:  \"That I know nothing about\n",
      "myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems\n",
      "from one cause, a single cause:  I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing\n",
      "from myself!  I searched Atman, I searched Brahman, I was willing to\n",
      "dissect my self and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of\n",
      "all peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the\n",
      "ultimate part.  But I have lost myself in the process.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha opened his eyes and looked around, a smile filled his face\n",
      "and a feeling of awakening from long dreams flowed through him from his\n",
      "head down to his toes.  And it was not long before he walked again,\n",
      "walked quickly like a man who knows what he has got to do.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh,\" he thought, taking a deep breath, \"now I would not let Siddhartha\n",
      "escape from me again!  No longer, I want to begin my thoughts and my\n",
      "life with Atman and with the suffering of the world.  I do not want to\n",
      "kill and dissect myself any longer, to find a secret behind the ruins.\n",
      "Neither Yoga-Veda shall teach me any more, nor Atharva-Veda, nor the\n",
      "ascetics, nor any kind of teachings.  I want to learn from myself, want\n",

      "\n",
      "He looked around, as if he was seeing the world for the first time.\n",
      "Beautiful was the world, colourful was the world, strange and mysterious\n",
      "was the world!  Here was blue, here was yellow, here was green, the sky\n",
      "and the river flowed, the forest and the mountains were rigid, all of it\n",
      "was beautiful, all of it was mysterious and magical, and in its midst was\n",
      "he, Siddhartha, the awakening one, on the path to himself.  All of this,\n",
      "all this yellow and blue, river and forest, entered Siddhartha for the\n",

      "it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he still had to go\n",
      "to reach the large city.  Then she got up and came to him, beautifully\n",

      "down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her\n",

      "\n",
      "The next person who came along this path he asked about the grove and\n",

      "stairs of stone by the river.  When the evening came, he made friends\n",
      "with barber's assistant, whom he had seen working in the shade of an\n",
      "arch in a building, whom he found again praying in a temple of Vishnu,\n",
      "whom he told about stories of Vishnu and the Lakshmi.  Among the boats\n",
      "by the river, he slept this night, and early in the morning, before the\n",

      "\n",

      "now, Samana from the forest?  Did you mark my words?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have marked your words,\" Siddhartha exclaimed.  \"How should I\n",

      "a freshly cracked fig, Kamala.  My mouth is red and fresh as well, it\n",
      "will be a suitable match for yours, you'll see.--But tell me, beautiful\n",
      "Kamala, aren't you at all afraid of the Samana from the forest, who has\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Whatever for should I be afraid of a Samana, a stupid Samana from the\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No, Samana, I am not afraid of this.  Did any Samana or Brahman ever\n",
      "fear, someone might come and grab him and steal his learning, and his\n",
      "religious devotion, and his depth of thought?  No, for they are his very\n",
      "own, and he would only give away from those whatever he is willing to\n",
      "give and to whomever he is willing to give.  Like this it is, precisely\n",
      "like this it is also with Kamala and with the pleasures of love.\n",
      "Beautiful and red is Kamala's mouth, but just try to kiss it against\n",
      "Kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness from\n",
      "it, which knows how to give so many sweet things!  You are learning\n",
      "easily, Siddhartha, thus you should also learn this: love can be\n",
      "obtained by begging, buying, receiving it as a gift, finding it in the\n",
      "street, but it cannot be stolen.  In this, you have come up with the\n",
      "wrong path.  No, it would be a pity, if a pretty young man like you\n",

      "deep astonishment Siddhartha felt how she taught him, how wise she was,\n",
      "how she controlled him, rejected him, lured him, and how after this first\n",
      "one there was to be a long, a well ordered, well tested sequence of\n",
      "kisses, everyone different from the others, he was still to receive.\n",
      "Breathing deeply, he remained standing where he was, and was in this\n",

      "sound.  Contently, he returned to the city, carrying the rolled up\n",

      "positioned himself by the door, without words he asked for food, without\n",

      "he thought, I will ask no one for food any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, pride flared up in him.  He was no Samana any more, it was no\n",

      "nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things\n",
      "of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without\n",
      "stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall.  His goal attracts him,\n",
      "because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the\n",
      "goal.  This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas.  This is\n",
      "what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by\n",
      "means of the daemons.  Nothing is effected by daemons, there are no\n",
      "daemons.  Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if\n",
      "he is able to think, if he is able to wait, if he is able to fast.\"\n",

      "Kamaswami entered, a swiftly, smoothly moving man with very gray hair,\n",
      "with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth.  Politely,\n",
      "the host and the guest greeted one another.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Siddhartha, \"I have not become destitute and have never been\n",
      "destitute.  You should know that I'm coming from the Samanas, with\n",
      "whom I have lived for a long time.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Surely, I am without possessions.  But I am so voluntarily, and\n",

      "\n",
      "\"But what are you planning to live of, being without possessions?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "been without possessions, and have never thought about of what I should\n",
      "live.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So you've lived of the possessions of others.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Presumable this is how it is.  After all, a merchant also lives of\n",
      "what other people own.\"\n",

      "\"Well said.  But he wouldn't take anything from another person for\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It is very good, sir.  When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the\n",

      "learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this\n",
      "day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would\n",
      "force him to do so.  But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows\n",
      "no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow\n",

      "of the body, however small it was, had its secret, which would bring\n",

      "without one admiring the other, without being just as defeated as they\n",
      "have been victorious, so that with none of them should start feeling\n",
      "fed up or bored and get that evil feeling of having abused or having\n",

      "he stepped in front of the cage and looked inside; there the small bird\n",
      "was dead and lay stiff on the ground.  He took it out, weighed it for a\n",
      "moment in his hand, and then threw it away, out in the street, and in\n",
      "the same moment, he felt terribly shocked, and his heart hurt, as if he\n",

      "you.\"  And again, as a young man, when the ever rising, upward fleeing,\n",

      "\n",

      "water, how did it delight him, how grateful was he to it!  In his heart\n",
      "he heard the voice talking, which was newly awaking, and it told him:\n",
      "Love this water!  Stay near it!  Learn from it!  Oh yes, he wanted to\n",

      "my hut, this was a long time ago, possibly more than twenty years ago,\n",
      "and you've been ferried across the river by me, and we parted like good\n",

      "\"My name is Siddhartha, and I was a Samana, when you've last seen me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So be welcome, Siddhartha.  My name is Vasudeva.  You will, so I hope,\n",
      "be my guest today as well and sleep in my hut, and tell me, where you're\n",
      "coming from and why these beautiful clothes are such a nuisance to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reached the middle of the river, and Vasudeva pushed the oar\n",
      "with more strength, in order to overcome the current.  He worked calmly,\n",
      "his eyes fixed in on the front of the boat, with brawny arms.\n",
      "Siddhartha sat and watched him, and remembered, how once before, on that\n",
      "last day of his time as a Samana, love for this man had stirred in his\n",
      "heart.  Gratefully, he accepted Vasudeva's invitation.  When they had\n",
      "reached the bank, he helped him to tie the boat to the stakes; after\n",
      "this, the ferryman asked him to enter the hut, offered him bread and\n",
      "water, and Siddhartha ate with eager pleasure, and also ate with eager\n",
      "pleasure of the mango fruits, Vasudeva offered him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, it was almost the time of the sunset, they sat on a log by\n",
      "the bank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman about where he originally\n",
      "came from and about his life, as he had seen it before his eyes today,\n",
      "in that hour of despair.  Until late at night, lasted his tale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva listened with great attention.  Listening carefully, he let\n",
      "everything enter his mind, birthplace and childhood, all that learning,\n",
      "all that searching, all joy, all distress.  This was among the\n",
      "ferryman's virtues one of the greatest:  like only a few, he knew how\n",
      "to listen.  Without him having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how\n",
      "Vasudeva let his words enter his mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he\n",
      "did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience,\n",
      "did not add his praise or rebuke, was just listening.  Siddhartha felt,\n",
      "what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to bury in\n",
      "his heart his own life, his own search, his own suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the end of Siddhartha's tale, when he spoke of the tree by the\n",
      "river, and of his deep fall, of the holy Om, and how he had felt such\n",
      "a love for the river after his slumber, the ferryman listened with twice\n",
      "the attention, entirely and completely absorbed by it, with his eyes\n",
      "closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Siddhartha fell silent, and a long silence had occurred, then\n",
      "Vasudeva said:  \"It is as I thought.  The river has spoken to you.  It\n",
      "is your friend as well, it speaks to you as well.  That is good, that is\n",
      "very good.  Stay with me, Siddhartha, my friend.  I used to have a wife,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I thank you,\" said Siddhartha, \"I thank you and accept.  And I also\n",

      "are rare who know how to listen.  And I did not meet a single one who\n",

      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will learn it,\" spoke Vasudeva, \"but not from me.  The river has\n",
      "taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well.  It knows\n",
      "everything, the river, everything can be learned from it.  See, you've\n",
      "already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive\n",

      "tell you that other thing, oh friend.  You'll learn it, or perhaps you\n",
      "know it already.  See, I'm no learned man, I have no special skill in\n",
      "speaking, I also have no special skill in thinking.  All I'm able to do\n",
      "is to listen and to be godly, I have learned nothing else.  If I was\n",

      "nothing but an obstacle on their travels.  They travelled to seek money\n",
      "and business, and for weddings, and on pilgrimages, and the river was\n",
      "obstructing their path, and the ferryman's job was to get them quickly\n",
      "across that obstacle.  But for some among thousands, a few, four or\n",
      "five, the river has stopped being an obstacle, they have heard its\n",

      "words.  Vasudeva was no friend of words; rarely, Siddhartha succeeded\n",
      "in persuading him to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you,\" so he asked him at one time, \"did you too learn that secret\n",
      "from the river: that there is no time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva's face was filled with a bright smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Siddhartha,\" he spoke.  \"It is this what you mean, isn't it: that\n",
      "the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the\n",
      "waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains,\n",
      "everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not\n",
      "the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This it is,\" said Siddhartha.  \"And when I had learned it, I looked at\n",
      "my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only\n",
      "separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a\n",
      "shadow, not by something real.  Also, Siddhartha's previous births were\n",
      "no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future.  Nothing\n",
      "was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is\n",
      "present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha spoke with ecstasy; deeply, this enlightenment had delighted\n",
      "him.  Oh, was not all suffering time, were not all forms of tormenting\n",
      "oneself and being afraid time, was not everything hard, everything\n",
      "hostile in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time,\n",
      "as soon as time would have been put out of existence by one's thoughts?\n",
      "In ecstatic delight, he had spoken, but Vasudeva smiled at him brightly\n",
      "and nodded in confirmation; silently he nodded, brushed his hand over\n",
      "Siddhartha's shoulder, turned back to his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And once again, when the river had just increased its flow in the rainy\n",
      "season and made a powerful noise, then said Siddhartha:  \"Isn't it so,\n",
      "oh friend, the river has many voices, very many voices?  Hasn't it the\n",
      "voice of a king, and of a warrior, and of a bull, and of a bird of the\n",
      "night, and of a woman giving birth, and of a sighing man, and a thousand\n",
      "other voices more?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is,\" Vasudeva nodded, \"all voices of the creatures are in its\n",
      "voice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you know,\" Siddhartha continued, \"what word it speaks, when you\n",
      "succeed in hearing all of its ten thousand voices at once?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, Vasudeva's face was smiling, he bent over to Siddhartha and\n",
      "spoke the holy Om into his ear.  And this had been the very thing which\n",
      "Siddhartha had also been hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And time after time, his smile became more similar to the ferryman's,\n",
      "became almost just as bright, almost just as throughly glowing with\n",
      "bliss, just as shining out of thousand small wrinkles, just as alike to\n",
      "a child's, just as alike to an old man's.  Many travellers, seeing the\n",
      "two ferrymen, thought they were brothers.  Often, they sat in the\n",
      "evening together by the bank on the log, said nothing and both listened\n",
      "to the water, which was no water to them, but the voice of life, the\n",
      "voice of what exists, of what is eternally taking shape.  And it\n",
      "happened from time to time that both, when listening to the river,\n",
      "thought of the same things, of a conversation from the day before\n",
      "yesterday, of one of their travellers, the face and fate of whom had\n",
      "occupied their thoughts, of death, of their childhood, and that they\n",
      "both in the same moment, when the river had been saying something good\n",
      "to them, looked at each other, both thinking precisely the same thing,\n",
      "both delighted about the same answer to the same question.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something about this ferry and the two ferrymen which was\n",
      "transmitted to others, which many of the travellers felt.  It happened\n",
      "occasionally that a traveller, after having looked at the face of one of\n",
      "the ferrymen, started to tell the story of his life, told about pains,\n",
      "confessed evil things, asked for comfort and advice.  It happened\n",
      "occasionally that someone asked for permission to stay for a night with\n",
      "them to listen to the river.  It also happened that curious people came,\n",
      "who had been told that there were two wise men, or sorcerers, or holy\n",
      "men living by that ferry.  The curious people asked many questions, but\n",
      "they got no answers, and they found neither sorcerers nor wise men, they\n",
      "only found two friendly little old men, who seemed to be mute and to\n",
      "have become a bit strange and gaga.  And the curious people laughed and\n",
      "were discussing how foolishly and gullibly the common people were\n",
      "spreading such empty rumours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The years passed by, and nobody counted them.  Then, at one time, monks\n",
      "came by on a pilgrimage, followers of Gotama, the Buddha, who were\n",
      "asking to be ferried across the river, and by them the ferrymen were\n",
      "told that they were most hurriedly walking back to their great\n",
      "teacher, for the news had spread the exalted one was deadly sick and\n",
      "would soon die his last human death, in order to become one with the\n",
      "salvation.  It was not long, until a new flock of monks came along on\n",
      "their pilgrimage, and another one, and the monks as well as most of the\n",
      "other travellers and people walking through the land spoke of nothing\n",
      "else than of Gotama and his impending death.  And as people are flocking\n",
      "from everywhere and from all sides, when they are going to war or to the\n",
      "coronation of a king, and are gathering like ants in droves, thus they\n",
      "flocked, like being drawn on by a magic spell, to where the great Buddha\n",
      "was awaiting his death, where the huge event was to take place and the\n",
      "great perfected one of an era was to become one with the glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, Siddhartha thought in those days of the dying wise man, the\n",

      "hundreds of thousands, whose voice he had also once heard, whose holy\n",
      "face he had also once seen with respect.  Kindly, he thought of him, saw\n",
      "his path to perfection before his eyes, and remembered with a smile\n",
      "those words which he had once, as a young man, said to him, the exalted\n",
      "one.  They had been, so it seemed to him, proud and precocious words;\n",
      "with a smile, he remembered them.  For a long time he knew that there\n",
      "was nothing standing between Gotama and him any more, though he was\n",
      "still unable to accept his teachings.  No, there was no teaching a\n",
      "truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept.\n",
      "But he who had found, he could approve of any teachings, every path,\n",
      "every goal, there was nothing standing between him and all the other\n",

      "On one of these days, when so many went on a pilgrimage to the dying\n",

      "her refuge in the teachings, was among the friends and benefactors of\n",
      "the pilgrims.  Together with Siddhartha the boy, her son, she had gone\n",
      "on her way due to the news of the near death of Gotama, in simple\n",
      "clothes, on foot.  With her little son, she was travelling by the river;\n",
      "but the boy had soon grown tired, desired to go back home, desired to\n",
      "rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamala often had to take a rest with him, he was accustomed to having\n",

      "and sad pilgrimage with his mother, to an unknown place, to a stranger,\n",
      "who was holy and about to die.  So what if he died, how did this concern\n",
      "the boy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilgrims were getting close to Vasudeva's ferry, when little\n",

      "had also become tired, and while the boy was chewing a banana, she\n",
      "crouched down on the ground, closed her eyes a bit, and rested.  But\n",
      "suddenly, she uttered a wailing scream, the boy looked at her in fear\n",
      "and saw her face having grown pale from horror; and from under her\n",
      "dress, a small, black snake fled, by which Kamala had been bitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurriedly, they now both ran along the path, in order to reach people,\n",
      "and got near to the ferry, there Kamala collapsed, and was not able to\n",
      "go any further.  But the boy started crying miserably, only interrupting\n",
      "it to kiss and hug his mother, and she also joined his loud screams for\n",
      "help, until the sound reached Vasudeva's ears, who stood at the ferry.\n",
      "Quickly, he came walking, took the woman on his arms, carried her into\n",
      "the boat, the boy ran along, and soon they all reached the hut, were\n",
      "Siddhartha stood by the stove and was just lighting the fire.  He looked\n",
      "up and first saw the boy's face, which wondrously reminded him of\n",
      "something, like a warning to remember something he had forgotten.  Then\n",
      "he saw Kamala, whom he instantly recognised, though she lay unconscious\n",
      "in the ferryman's arms, and now he knew that it was his own son, whose\n",

      "realized her situation, remembered the bite, called timidly for the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's with you, don't worry,\" said Siddhartha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamala looked into his eyes.  She spoke with a heavy tongue, paralysed\n",
      "by the poison.  \"You've become old, my dear,\" she said, \"you've become\n",
      "gray.  But you are like the young Samana, who at one time came without\n",
      "clothes, with dusty feet, to me into the garden.  You are much more like\n",
      "him, than you were like him at that time when you had left me and\n",

      "the perfected one, to breathe his peace, and she thought that she had\n",
      "now found him in his place, and that it was good, just as good, as if\n",
      "she had seen the other one.  She wanted to tell this to him, but the\n",
      "tongue no longer obeyed her will.  Without speaking, she looked at him,\n",
      "and he saw the life fading from her eyes.  When the final pain filled\n",
      "her eyes and made them grow dim, when the final shiver ran through her\n",
      "limbs, his finger closed her eyelids.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, he sat and looked at her peacefully dead face.  For a\n",
      "long time, he observed her mouth, her old, tired mouth, with those lips,\n",
      "which had become thin, and he remembered, that he used to, in the spring\n",
      "of his years, compare this mouth with a freshly cracked fig.  For a long\n",
      "time, he sat, read in the pale face, in the tired wrinkles, filled\n",
      "himself with this sight, saw his own face lying in the same manner,\n",
      "just as white, just as quenched out, and saw at the same time his face\n",
      "and hers being young, with red lips, with fiery eyes, and the feeling of\n",
      "this both being present and at the same time real, the feeling of\n",
      "eternity, completely filled every aspect of his being.  Deeply he felt,\n",
      "more deeply than ever before, in this hour, the indestructibility of\n",
      "every life, the eternity of every moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he rose, Vasudeva had prepared rice for him.  But Siddhartha did\n",
      "not eat.  In the stable, where their goat stood, the two old men\n",
      "prepared beds of straw for themselves, and Vasudeva lay himself down\n",
      "to sleep.  But Siddhartha went outside and sat this night before the\n",
      "hut, listening to the river, surrounded by the past, touched and\n",
      "encircled by all times of his life at the same time.  But occasionally,\n",
      "he rose, stepped to the door of the hut and listened, whether the boy\n",
      "was sleeping.\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in the morning, even before the sun could be seen, Vasudeva came\n",
      "out of the stable and walked over to his friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You haven't slept,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, Vasudeva.  I sat here, I was listening to the river.  A lot it has\n",
      "told me, deeply it has filled me with the healing thought, with the\n",
      "thought of oneness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You've experienced suffering, Siddhartha, but I see: no sadness has\n",

      "\"No, my dear, how should I be sad?  I, who have been rich and happy,\n",
      "have become even richer and happier now.  My son has been given to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Your son shall be welcome to me as well.  But now, Siddhartha, let's\n",
      "get to work, there is much to be done.  Kamala has died on the same bed,\n",
      "on which my wife had died a long time ago.  Let us also build Kamala's\n",

      "THE SON\n",
      "\n",
      "Timid and weeping, the boy had attended his mother's funeral; gloomy\n",
      "and shy, he had listened to Siddhartha, who greeted him as his son and\n",
      "welcomed him at his place in Vasudeva's hut.  Pale, he sat for many\n",
      "days by the hill of the dead, did not want to eat, gave no open look,\n",
      "did not open his heart, met his fate with resistance and denial.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha spared him and let him do as he pleased, he honoured his\n",
      "mourning.  Siddhartha understood that his son did not know him, that\n",
      "he could not love him like a father.  Slowly, he also saw and understood\n",
      "that the eleven-year-old was a pampered boy, a mother's boy, and that he\n",
      "had grown up in the habits of rich people, accustomed to finer food, to\n",
      "a soft bed, accustomed to giving orders to servants.  Siddhartha\n",
      "understood that the mourning, pampered child could not suddenly and\n",
      "willingly be content with a life among strangers and in poverty.  He did\n",
      "not force him, he did many a chore for him, always picked the best piece\n",
      "of the meal for him.  Slowly, he hoped to win him over, by friendly\n",
      "patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich and happy, he had called himself, when the boy had come to him.\n",
      "Since time had passed on in the meantime, and the boy remained a\n",
      "stranger and in a gloomy disposition, since he displayed a proud and\n",
      "stubbornly disobedient heart, did not want to do any work, did not pay\n",
      "his respect to the old men, stole from Vasudeva's fruit-trees, then\n",
      "Siddhartha began to understand that his son had not brought him\n",
      "happiness and peace, but suffering and worry.  But he loved him, and he\n",
      "preferred the suffering and worries of love over happiness and joy\n",
      "without the boy.  Since young Siddhartha was in the hut, the old men had\n",
      "split the work.  Vasudeva had again taken on the job of the ferryman all\n",
      "by himself, and Siddhartha, in order to be with his son, did the work in\n",
      "the hut and the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, for long months, Siddhartha waited for his son to\n",
      "understand him, to accept his love, to perhaps reciprocate it.  For\n",
      "long months, Vasudeva waited, watching, waited and said nothing.  One\n",
      "day, when Siddhartha the younger had once again tormented his father\n",
      "very much with spite and an unsteadiness in his wishes and had broken\n",
      "both of his rice-bowls, Vasudeva took in the evening his friend aside\n",
      "and talked to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me.\" he said, \"from a friendly heart, I'm talking to you.  I'm\n",
      "seeing that you are tormenting yourself, I'm seeing that you're in grief.\n",
      "Your son, my dear, is worrying you, and he is also worrying me.  That\n",
      "young bird is accustomed to a different life, to a different nest.  He\n",
      "has not, like you, ran away from riches and the city, being disgusted\n",
      "and fed up with it; against his will, he had to leave all this behind.\n",
      "I asked the river, oh friend, many times I have asked it.  But the river\n",
      "laughs, it laughs at me, it laughs at you and me, and is shaking with\n",
      "laughter at out foolishness.  Water wants to join water, youth wants to\n",
      "join youth, your son is not in the place where he can prosper.  You too\n",

      "of which there was incessant cheerfulness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How could I part with him?\" he said quietly, ashamed.  \"Give me some\n",
      "more time, my dear!  See, I'm fighting for him, I'm seeking to win his\n",

      "he is called upon to do, what path to take, what actions to perform,\n",
      "what pain to endure?  Not a small one, his pain will be; after all, his\n",
      "heart is proud and hard, people like this have to suffer a lot, err a\n",

      "neither perished nor was in any danger in the forest.  Nevertheless, he\n",
      "ran without stopping, no longer to save him, just to satisfy his desire,\n",
      "just to perhaps see him one more time.  And he ran up to just outside of\n",

      "\n",
      "When, near the city, he reached a wide road, he stopped, by the entrance\n",
      "of the beautiful pleasure-garden, which used to belong to Kamala, where\n",
      "he had seen her for the first time in her sedan-chair.  The past rose\n",
      "up in his soul, again he saw himself standing there, young, a bearded,\n",
      "naked Samana, the hair full of dust.  For a long time, Siddhartha stood\n",

      "yellow robes walking among the beautiful trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, he stood there, pondering, seeing images, listening to\n",
      "the story of his life.  For a long time, he stood there, looked at the\n",
      "monks, saw young Siddhartha in their place, saw young Kamala walking\n",
      "among the high trees.  Clearly, he saw himself being served food and\n",
      "drink by Kamala, receiving his first kiss from her, looking proudly and\n",
      "disdainfully back on his Brahmanism, beginning proudly and full of\n",
      "desire his worldly life.  He saw Kamaswami, saw the servants, the\n",
      "orgies, the gamblers with the dice, the musicians, saw Kamala's\n",
      "song-bird in the cage, lived through all this once again, breathed\n",
      "Sansara, was once again old and tired, felt once again disgust, felt\n",

      "After having been standing by the gate of the garden for a long time,\n",

      "allowed to cling him.  Deeply, he felt the love for the run-away in his\n",

      "not been given to him in order to turn the knife in it, that it had to\n",
      "become a blossom and had to shine.\n",
      "\n",
      "That this wound did not blossom yet, did not shine yet, at this hour,\n",
      "made him sad.  Instead of the desired goal, which had drawn him here\n",
      "following the runaway son, there was now emptiness.  Sadly, he sat down,\n",
      "felt something dying in his heart, experienced emptiness, saw no joy any\n",
      "more, no goal.  He sat lost in thought and waited.  This he had learned\n",
      "by the river, this one thing: waiting, having patience, listening\n",
      "attentively.  And he sat and listened, in the dust of the road, listened\n",
      "to his heart, beating tiredly and sadly, waited for a voice.  Many an\n",
      "hour he crouched, listening, saw no images any more, fell into\n",
      "emptiness, let himself fall, without seeing a path.  And when he felt\n",
      "the wound burning, he silently spoke the Om, filled himself with Om.\n",
      "The monks in the garden saw him, and since he crouched for many hours,\n",
      "and dust was gathering on his gray hair, one of them came to him and\n",
      "placed two bananas in front of him.  The old man did not see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this petrified state, he was awoken by a hand touching his\n",
      "shoulder.  Instantly, he recognised this touch, this tender, bashful\n",
      "touch, and regained his senses.  He rose and greeted Vasudeva, who had\n",
      "followed him.  And when he looked into Vasudeva's friendly face, into\n",
      "the small wrinkles, which were as if they were filled with nothing but\n",
      "his smile, into the happy eyes, then he smiled too.  Now he saw the\n",
      "bananas lying in front of him, picked them up, gave one to the ferryman,\n",
      "ate the other one himself.  After this, he silently went back into the\n",
      "forest with Vasudeva, returned home to the ferry.  Neither one talked\n",
      "about what had happened today, neither one mentioned the boy's name,\n",
      "neither one spoke about him running away, neither one spoke about the\n",
      "wound.  In the hut, Siddhartha lay down on his bed, and when after a\n",

      "brothers, their vanities, desires for possession, and ridiculous aspects\n",
      "were no longer ridiculous to him, became understandable, became lovable,\n",
      "even became worthy of veneration to him.  The blind love of a mother\n",

      "\n",
      "But the wound still burned, longingly and bitterly Siddhartha thought of\n",

      "who was regarded as a wise man by many.  When Govinda went back on his\n",

      "and are wearing the robe of Gotama's monks?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "venerable one?  Perhaps that you're searching far too much?  That in all\n",
      "that searching, you don't find the time for finding?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How come?\" asked Govinda.\n",
      "\n",

      "happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he searches\n",
      "for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his mind,\n",
      "because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search,\n",
      "because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal.  Searching\n",
      "means: having a goal.  But finding means: being free, being open, having\n",
      "no goal.  You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because,\n",
      "striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are\n",
      "directly in front of your eyes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't quite understand yet,\" asked Govinda, \"what do you mean by\n",

      "\n",

      "those days when we lived with the penitents in the forest, started to\n",
      "distrust teachers and teachings and to turn my back to them.  I have\n",
      "stuck with this.  Nevertheless, I have had many teachers since then.  A\n",
      "beautiful courtesan has been my teacher for a long time, and a rich\n",
      "merchant was my teacher, and some gamblers with dice.  Once, even a\n",
      "follower of Buddha, travelling on foot, has been my teacher; he sat with\n",
      "me when I had fallen asleep in the forest, on the pilgrimage.  I've also\n",
      "learned from him, I'm also grateful to him, very grateful.  But most of\n",
      "all, I have learned here from this river and from my predecessor, the\n",
      "ferryman Vasudeva.  He was a very simple person, Vasudeva, he was no\n",
      "thinker, but he knew what is necessary just as well as Gotama, he was a\n",
      "perfect man, a saint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Govinda said:  \"Still, oh Siddhartha, you love a bit to mock people, as\n",

      "teacher.  But haven't you found something by yourself, though you've\n",
      "found no teachings, you still found certain thoughts, certain insights,\n",

      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha:  \"I've had thoughts, yes, and insight, again and\n",
      "again.  Sometimes, for an hour or for an entire day, I have felt\n",
      "knowledge in me, as one would feel life in one's heart.  There have\n",
      "been many thoughts, but it would be hard for me to convey them to you.\n",
      "Look, my dear Govinda, this is one of my thoughts, which I have found:\n",
      "wisdom cannot be passed on.  Wisdom which a wise man tries to pass on\n",
      "to someone always sounds like foolishness.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Are you kidding?\" asked Govinda.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not kidding.  I'm telling you what I've found.  Knowledge can be\n",
      "conveyed, but not wisdom.  It can be found, it can be lived, it is\n",
      "possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it\n",
      "cannot be expressed in words and taught.  This was what I, even as a\n",
      "young man, sometimes suspected, what has driven me away from the\n",
      "teachers.  I have found a thought, Govinda, which you'll again regard as\n",
      "a joke or foolishness, but which is my best thought.  It says:  The\n",
      "opposite of every truth is just as true!  That's like this: any truth\n",
      "can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided.\n",
      "Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with\n",
      "words, it's all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness,\n",
      "roundness, oneness.  When the exalted Gotama spoke in his teachings of\n",
      "the world, he had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into deception\n",
      "and truth, into suffering and salvation.  It cannot be done differently,\n",
      "there is no other way for him who wants to teach.  But the world itself,\n",
      "what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided.  A person or\n",
      "an act is never entirely Sansara or entirely Nirvana, a person is never\n",
      "entirely holy or entirely sinful.  It does really seem like this,\n",
      "because we are subject to deception, as if time was something real.\n",
      "Time is not real, Govinda, I have experienced this often and often\n",
      "again.  And if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between\n",
      "the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between\n",
      "evil and good, is also a deception.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "will reach the Nirvana, will be Buddha--and now see: these 'times to\n",
      "come' are a deception, are only a parable!  The sinner is not on his\n",
      "way to become a Buddha, he is not in the process of developing, though\n",
      "our capacity for thinking does not know how else to picture these\n",
      "things.  No, within the sinner is now and today already the future\n",
      "Buddha, his future is already all there, you have to worship in him, in\n",
      "you, in everyone the Buddha which is coming into being, the possible,\n",
      "the hidden Buddha.  The world, my friend Govinda, is not imperfect, or\n",
      "on a slow path towards perfection: no, it is perfect in every moment,\n",
      "all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself, all small\n",
      "children already have the old person in themselves, all infants already\n",
      "have death, all dying people the eternal life.  It is not possible for\n",

      "path; in the robber and dice-gambler, the Buddha is waiting; in the\n",
      "Brahman, the robber is waiting.  In deep meditation, there is the\n",

      "is, and will be as if it was simultaneous, and there everything is\n",
      "good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman.  Therefore, I see\n",
      "whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness,\n",
      "wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only\n",
      "requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be\n",
      "good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever\n",
      "harm me.  I have experienced on my body and on my soul that I needed sin\n",
      "very much, I needed lust, the desire for possessions, vanity, and needed\n",
      "the most shameful despair, in order to learn how to give up all\n",
      "resistance, in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop\n",
      "comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection\n",
      "I had made up, but to leave it as it is and to love it and to enjoy\n",

      "Maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a\n",
      "spirit in the cycle of transformations, therefore I also grant it\n",
      "importance.  Thus, I would perhaps have thought in the past.  But today\n",

      "also Buddha, I do not venerate and love it because it could turn into\n",
      "this or that, but rather because it is already and always everything--\n",
      "and it is this very fact, that it is a stone, that it appears to me now\n",

      "prays the Om in its own way, each one is Brahman, but simultaneously and\n",
      "just as much it is a stone, is oily or juicy, and this is this very fact\n",
      "which I like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship.--But let me\n",
      "speak no more of this.  The words are not good for the secret meaning,\n",

      "To be honest, I also have no high opinion of thoughts.  I have a better\n",
      "opinion of things.  Here on this ferry-boat, for instance, a man has\n",
      "been my predecessor and teacher, a holy man, who has for many years\n",
      "simply believed in the river, nothing else.  He had noticed that the\n",
      "river's spoke to him, he learned from it, it educated and taught him,\n",
      "the river seemed to be a god to him, for many years he did not know that\n",
      "every wind, every cloud, every bird, every beetle was just as divine and\n",
      "knows just as much and can teach just as much as the worshipped river.\n",
      "But when this holy man went into the forests, he knew everything, knew\n",
      "more than you and me, without teachers, without books, only because he\n",
      "had believed in the river.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Govinda said:  \"But is that what you call `things', actually something\n",
      "real, something which has existence?  Isn't it just a deception of the\n",
      "Maja, just an image and illusion?  Your stone, your tree, your river--\n",
      "are they actually a reality?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This too,\" spoke Siddhartha, \"I do not care very much about.  Let the\n",
      "things be illusions or not, after all I would then also be an illusion,\n",
      "and thus they are always like me.  This is what makes them so dear and\n",
      "worthy of veneration for me: they are like me.  Therefore, I can love\n",
      "them.  And this is now a teaching you will laugh about: love, oh\n",
      "Govinda, seems to me to be the most important thing of all.  To\n",
      "thoroughly understand the world, to explain it, to despise it, may be\n",
      "the thing great thinkers do.  But I'm only interested in being able to\n",
      "love the world, not to despise it, not to hate it and me, to be able to\n",
      "look upon it and me and all beings with love and admiration and great\n",
      "respect.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This I understand,\" spoke Govinda.  \"But this very thing was discovered\n",
      "by the exalted one to be a deception.  He commands benevolence,\n",
      "clemency, sympathy, tolerance, but not love; he forbade us to tie our\n",
      "heart in love to earthly things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it,\" said Siddhartha; his smile shone golden.  \"I know it,\n",
      "Govinda.  And behold, with this we are right in the middle of the\n",
      "thicket of opinions, in the dispute about words.  For I cannot deny, my\n",
      "words of love are in a contradiction, a seeming contradiction with\n",
      "Gotama's words.  For this very reason, I distrust in words so much, for\n",
      "I know, this contradiction is a deception.  I know that I am in\n",
      "agreement with Gotama.  How should he not know love, he, who has\n",
      "discovered all elements of human existence in their transitoriness, in\n",
      "their meaninglessness, and yet loved people thus much, to use a long,\n",
      "laborious life only to help them, to teach them!  Even with him, even\n",
      "with your great teacher, I prefer the thing over the words, place more\n",
      "importance on his acts and life than on his speeches, more on the\n",
      "gestures of his hand than his opinions.  Not in his speech, not in his\n",
      "thoughts, I see his greatness, only in his actions, in his life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, the two old men said nothing.  Then spoke Govinda,\n",
      "while bowing for a farewell:  \"I thank you, Siddhartha, for telling me\n",
      "some of your thoughts.  They are partially strange thoughts, not all\n",
      "have been instantly understandable to me.  This being as it may, I thank\n",
      "you, and I wish you to have calm days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(But secretly he thought to himself:  This Siddhartha is a bizarre\n",
      "person, he expresses bizarre thoughts, his teachings sound foolish.\n",
      "So differently sound the exalted one's pure teachings, clearer, purer,\n",
      "more comprehensible, nothing strange, foolish, or silly is contained in\n",
      "them.  But different from his thoughts seemed to me Siddhartha's hands\n",
      "and feet, his eyes, his forehead, his breath, his smile, his greeting,\n",
      "his walk.  Never again, after our exalted Gotama has become one with the\n",
      "Nirvana, never since then have I met a person of whom I felt: this is a\n",
      "holy man!  Only him, this Siddhartha, I have found to be like this.  May\n",
      "his teachings be strange, may his words sound foolish; out of his gaze\n",
      "and his hand, his skin and his hair, out of every part of him shines a\n",
      "purity, shines a calmness, shines a cheerfulness and mildness and\n",
      "holiness, which I have seen in no other person since the final death of\n",
      "our exalted teacher.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As Govinda thought like this, and there was a conflict in his heart, he\n",
      "once again bowed to Siddhartha, drawn by love.  Deeply he bowed to him\n",
      "who was calmly sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Siddhartha,\" he spoke, \"we have become old men.  It is unlikely for\n",
      "one of us to see the other again in this incarnation.  I see, beloved,\n",
      "that you have found peace.  I confess that I haven't found it.  Tell me,\n",
      "oh honourable one, one more word, give me something on my way which I\n",
      "can grasp, which I can understand!  Give me something to be with me on\n",
      "my path.  It is often hard, my path, often dark, Siddhartha.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha said nothing and looked at him with the ever unchanged,\n",
      "quiet smile.  Govinda stared at his face, with fear, with yearning,\n",
      "suffering, and the eternal search was visible in his look, eternal\n",
      "not-finding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha saw it and smiled.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bend down to me!\" he whispered quietly in Govinda's ear.  \"Bend down to\n",
      "me!  Like this, even closer!  Very close!  Kiss my forehead, Govinda!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But while Govinda with astonishment, and yet drawn by great love and\n",
      "expectation, obeyed his words, bent down closely to him and touched his\n",
      "forehead with his lips, something miraculous happened to him.  While his\n",
      "thoughts were still dwelling on Siddhartha's wondrous words, while he\n",
      "was still struggling in vain and with reluctance to think away time, to\n",
      "imagine Nirvana and Sansara as one, while even a certain contempt for\n",
      "the words of his friend was fighting in him against an immense love and\n",
      "veneration, this happened to him:\n",
      "\n",
      "He no longer saw the face of his friend Siddhartha, instead he saw\n",
      "other faces, many, a long sequence, a flowing river of faces, of\n",
      "hundreds, of thousands, which all came and disappeared, and yet all\n",
      "seemed to be there simultaneously, which all constantly changed and\n",
      "renewed themselves, and which were still all Siddhartha.  He saw the\n",
      "face of a fish, a carp, with an infinitely painfully opened mouth, the\n",
      "face of a dying fish, with fading eyes--he saw the face of a new-born\n",
      "child, red and full of wrinkles, distorted from crying--he saw the face\n",
      "of a murderer, he saw him plunging a knife into the body of another\n",
      "person--he saw, in the same second, this criminal in bondage, kneeling\n",
      "and his head being chopped off by the executioner with one blow of his\n",
      "sword--he saw the bodies of men and women, naked in positions and cramps\n",
      "of frenzied love--he saw corpses stretched out, motionless, cold, void--\n",
      "he saw the heads of animals, of boars, of crocodiles, of elephants, of\n",
      "bulls, of birds--he saw gods, saw Krishna, saw Agni--he saw all of these\n",
      "figures and faces in a thousand relationships with one another, each one\n",
      "helping the other, loving it, hating it, destroying it, giving re-birth\n",
      "to it, each one was a will to die, a passionately painful confession of\n",
      "transitoriness, and yet none of them died, each one only transformed,\n",
      "was always re-born, received evermore a new face, without any time\n",
      "having passed between the one and the other face--and all of these\n",
      "figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along\n",
      "and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered by\n",
      "something thin, without individuality of its own, but yet existing, like\n",
      "a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of\n",
      "water, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha's smiling\n",
      "face, which he, Govinda, in this very same moment touched with his lips.\n",

      "oneness above the flowing forms, this smile of simultaneousness above\n",
      "the thousand births and deaths, this smile of Siddhartha was precisely\n",
      "the same, was precisely of the same kind as the quiet, delicate,\n",
      "impenetrable, perhaps benevolent, perhaps mocking, wise, thousand-fold\n",
      "smile of Gotama, the Buddha, as he had seen it himself with great\n",

      "again and again, though these reports only represented second- or\n",

      "him as if every joint of every finger of this hand was of these\n",
      "teachings, spoke of, breathed of, exhaled the fragrant of, glistened of\n",
      "truth.  This man, this Buddha was truthful down to the gesture of his\n",
      "last finger.  This man was holy.  Never before, Siddhartha had venerated\n",

      "\n",
      "But in the evening, when the heat cooled down and everyone in the camp\n",
      "started to bustle about and gathered around, they heard the Buddha\n",

      "full of suffering was the world, but salvation from suffering had been\n",
      "found:  salvation was obtained by him who would walk the path of the\n",
      "Buddha.  With a soft, yet firm voice the exalted one spoke, taught the\n",
      "four main doctrines, taught the eightfold path, patiently he went the\n",
      "usual path of the teachings, of the examples, of the repetitions,\n",
      "brightly and quietly his voice hovered over the listeners, like a light,\n",
      "like a starry sky.\n",

      "\n",

      "the gods.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Smiling, they parted.  Smiling, Siddhartha was happy about the\n",

      "At about noon, he came through a village.  In front of the mud cottages,\n",
      "children were rolling about in the street, were playing with\n",
      "pumpkin-seeds and sea-shells, screamed and wrestled, but they all\n",
      "timidly fled from the unknown Samana.  In the end of the village, the\n",
      "path led through a stream, and by the side of the stream, a young\n",
      "woman was kneeling and washing clothes.  When Siddhartha greeted her,\n",
      "she lifted her head and looked up to him with a smile, so that he saw\n",
      "the white in her eyes glistening.  He called out a blessing to her, as\n",
      "it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he still had to go\n",
      "to reach the large city.  Then she got up and came to him, beautifully\n",
      "her wet mouth was shimmering in her young face.  She exchanged humorous\n",
      "banter with him, asked whether he had eaten already, and whether it was\n",
      "true that the Samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not\n",
      "allowed to have any women with them.  While talking, she put her left\n",
      "foot on his right one and made a movement as a woman does who would want\n",
      "to initiate that kind of sexual pleasure with a man, which the textbooks\n",
      "call \"climbing a tree\".  Siddhartha felt his blood heating up, and since\n",
      "in this moment he had to think of his dream again, he bend slightly\n",
      "down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her\n",
      "breast.  Looking up, he saw her face smiling full of lust and her\n",
      "eyes, with contracted pupils, begging with desire.\n",
      "\n",

      "in this moment he heard, shuddering with awe, the voice if his innermost\n",
      "self, and this voice said No.  Then, all charms disappeared from the\n",
      "young woman's smiling face, he no longer saw anything else but the damp\n",
      "glance of a female animal in heat.  Politely, he petted her cheek,\n",
      "turned away from her and disappeared away from the disappointed woman\n",
      "with light steps into the bamboo-wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this day, he reached the large city before the evening, and was\n",
      "happy, for he felt the need to be among people.  For a long time, he\n",
      "had lived in the forests, and the straw hut of the ferryman, in which\n",
      "he had slept that night, had been the first roof for a long time he has\n",
      "had over his head.\n",
      "\n",
      "Before the city, in a beautifully fenced grove, the traveller came\n",
      "across a small group of servants, both male and female, carrying\n",
      "baskets.  In their midst, carried by four servants in an ornamental\n",
      "sedan-chair, sat a woman, the mistress, on red pillows under a colourful\n",
      "canopy.  Siddhartha stopped at the entrance to the pleasure-garden and\n",
      "watched the parade, saw the servants, the maids, the baskets, saw the\n",
      "sedan-chair and saw the lady in it.  Under black hair, which made to\n",
      "tower high on her head, he saw a very fair, very delicate, very smart\n",
      "face, a brightly red mouth, like a freshly cracked fig, eyebrows which\n",
      "were well tended and painted in a high arch, smart and watchful dark\n",
      "eyes, a clear, tall neck rising from a green and golden garment, resting\n",
      "fair hands, long and thin, with wide golden bracelets over the wrists.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha saw how beautiful she was, and his heart rejoiced.  He bowed\n",
      "deeply, when the sedan-chair came closer, and straightening up again,\n",
      "he looked at the fair, charming face, read for a moment in the smart\n",
      "eyes with the high arcs above, breathed in a slight fragrant, he did\n",
      "not know.  With a smile, the beautiful women nodded for a moment and\n",
      "disappeared into the grove, and then the servant as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus I am entering this city, Siddhartha thought, with a charming omen.\n",
      "He instantly felt drawn into the grove, but he thought about it, and\n",
      "only now he became aware of how the servants and maids had looked at him\n",
      "at the entrance, how despicable, how distrustful, how rejecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am still a Samana, he thought, I am still an ascetic and beggar.  I\n",
      "must not remain like this, I will not be able to enter the grove like\n",
      "this.  And he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next person who came along this path he asked about the grove and\n",
      "for the name of the woman, and was told that this was the grove of\n",
      "Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that, aside from the grove, she owned\n",
      "a house in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, he entered the city.  Now he had a goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuing his goal, he allowed the city to suck him in, drifted through\n",
      "the flow of the streets, stood still on the squares, rested on the\n",
      "stairs of stone by the river.  When the evening came, he made friends\n",
      "with barber's assistant, whom he had seen working in the shade of an\n",
      "arch in a building, whom he found again praying in a temple of Vishnu,\n",
      "whom he told about stories of Vishnu and the Lakshmi.  Among the boats\n",
      "by the river, he slept this night, and early in the morning, before the\n",
      "first customers came into his shop, he had the barber's assistant shave\n",
      "his beard and cut his hair, comb his hair and anoint it with fine oil.\n",
      "Then he went to take his bath in the river.\n",

      "received the courtesan's greeting.  But that servant who walked at the\n",
      "very end of her train he motioned to him and asked him to inform his\n",
      "mistress that a young Brahman would wish to talk to her.  After a while,\n",
      "the servant returned, asked him, who had been waiting, to follow him\n",
      "conducted him, who was following him, without a word into a pavilion,\n",
      "where Kamala was lying on a couch, and left him alone with her.\n",
      "\n",

      "Samana, and who has been a Samana for three years.  But now, I have\n",
      "left that path and came into this city, and the first one I met, even\n",
      "before I had entered the city, was you.  To say this, I have come to\n",
      "you, oh Kamala!  You are the first woman whom Siddhartha is not\n",

      "turn my eyes to the ground, when I'm coming across a beautiful woman.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamala smiled and played with her fan of peacocks' feathers.  And asked:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To tell you this and to thank you for being so beautiful.  And if it\n",
      "doesn't displease you, Kamala, I would like to ask you to be my friend\n",
      "and teacher, for I know nothing yet of that art which you have mastered\n",
      "in the highest degree.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "At this, Kamala laughed aloud.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Never before this has happened to me, my friend, that a Samana from the\n",
      "forest came to me and wanted to learn from me!  Never before this has\n",
      "happened to me, that a Samana came to me with long hair and an old, torn\n",
      "loin-cloth!  Many young men come to me, and there are also sons of\n",
      "Brahmans among them, but they come in beautiful clothes, they come in\n",
      "fine shoes, they have perfume in their hair and money in their pouches.\n",
      "This is, oh Samana, how the young men are like who come to me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha:  \"Already I am starting to learn from you.  Even\n",

      "still missing in me, oh excellent one: fine clothes, fine shoes, money\n",
      "in my pouch.  You shall know, Siddhartha has set harder goals for\n",
      "himself than such trifles, and he has reached them.  How shouldn't I\n",
      "reach that goal, which I have set for myself yesterday:  to be your\n",

      "learn quickly, Kamala, I have already learned harder things than what\n",
      "you're supposed to teach me.  And now let's get to it: You aren't\n",

      "now, Samana from the forest?  Did you mark my words?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I have marked your words,\" Siddhartha exclaimed.  \"How should I\n",
      "not mark words which are coming from such a mouth!  Your mouth is like\n",
      "a freshly cracked fig, Kamala.  My mouth is red and fresh as well, it\n",
      "will be a suitable match for yours, you'll see.--But tell me, beautiful\n",

      "own, and he would only give away from those whatever he is willing to\n",
      "give and to whomever he is willing to give.  Like this it is, precisely\n",
      "like this it is also with Kamala and with the pleasures of love.\n",

      "Kamala's will, and you will not obtain a single drop of sweetness from\n",
      "it, which knows how to give so many sweet things!  You are learning\n",
      "easily, Siddhartha, thus you should also learn this: love can be\n",
      "obtained by begging, buying, receiving it as a gift, finding it in the\n",
      "street, but it cannot be stolen.  In this, you have come up with the\n",
      "wrong path.  No, it would be a pity, if a pretty young man like you\n",

      "She beckoned him with her eyes, he tilted his head so that his face\n",
      "touched hers and placed his mouth on that mouth which was like a\n",
      "freshly cracked fig.  For a long time, Kamala kissed him, and with a\n",
      "deep astonishment Siddhartha felt how she taught him, how wise she was,\n",
      "how she controlled him, rejected him, lured him, and how after this first\n",
      "one there was to be a long, a well ordered, well tested sequence of\n",
      "kisses, everyone different from the others, he was still to receive.\n",
      "Breathing deeply, he remained standing where he was, and was in this\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Very beautiful are your verses,\" exclaimed Kamala, \"if I was rich, I\n",

      "sound.  Contently, he returned to the city, carrying the rolled up\n",
      "garments under his arm.  At the inn, where travellers stay, he\n",
      "positioned himself by the door, without words he asked for food, without\n",
      "a word he accepted a piece of rice-cake.  Perhaps as soon as tomorrow,\n",
      "he thought, I will ask no one for food any more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly, pride flared up in him.  He was no Samana any more, it was no\n",
      "longer becoming to him to beg.  He gave the rice-cake to a dog and\n",

      "his servant, you shall become his equal, or else I won't be satisfied\n",

      "learning and able to do many pretty things in the forest, which the\n",
      "likes of you aren't capable of.  The day before yesterday, I was still a\n",

      "nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things\n",
      "of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without\n",
      "stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall.  His goal attracts him,\n",
      "because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the\n",
      "goal.  This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas.  This is\n",
      "what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by\n",

      "with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth.  Politely,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Siddhartha, \"I have not become destitute and have never been\n",
      "destitute.  You should know that I'm coming from the Samanas, with\n",

      "of the body, however small it was, had its secret, which would bring\n",

      "children, joined in the celebration of a wedding, and returned extremely\n",
      "satisfied from his trip.  Kamaswami held against him that he had not\n",
      "turned back right away, that he had wasted time and money.  Siddhartha\n",
      "answered:  \"Stop scolding, dear friend!  Nothing was ever achieved by\n",
      "scolding.  If a loss has occurred, let me bear that loss.  I am very\n",
      "satisfied with this trip.  I have gotten to know many kinds of people,\n",

      "kindness and trust, I have found friendship.  Look, my dear, if I had\n",
      "been Kamaswami, I would have travelled back, being annoyed and in a\n",
      "hurry, as soon as I had seen that my purchase had been rendered\n",
      "impossible, and time and money would indeed have been lost.  But like\n",
      "this, I've had a few good days, I've learned, had joy, I've neither\n",
      "harmed myself nor others by annoyance and hastiness.  And if I'll ever\n",
      "return there again, perhaps to buy an upcoming harvest, or for whatever\n",
      "purpose it might be, friendly people will receive me in a friendly and\n",
      "happy manner, and I will praise myself for not showing any hurry and\n",
      "displeasure at that time.  So, leave it as it is, my friend, and don't\n",

      "\n",
      "Futile were also the merchant's attempts, to convince Siddhartha that he\n",

      "ate other people's bread, all people's bread.  Siddhartha never listened\n",
      "to Kamaswami's worries and Kamaswami had many worries.  Whether there\n",

      "him that he had learned everything he knew from him, he replied:  \"Would\n",

      "Indeed his soul was not with the trade.  The business was good enough\n",
      "to provide him with the money for Kamala, and it earned him much more\n",

      "was only concerned with the people, whose businesses, crafts, worries,\n",
      "pleasures, and acts of foolishness used to be as alien and distant to\n",

      "aware that there was something which separated him from them and this\n",
      "separating factor was him being a Samana.  He saw mankind going through\n",
      "life in a childlike or animallike manner, which he loved and also\n",
      "despised at the same time.  He saw them toiling, saw them suffering,\n",
      "and becoming gray for the sake of things which seemed to him to entirely\n",
      "unworthy of this price, for money, for little pleasures, for being\n",
      "slightly honoured, he saw them scolding and insulting each other, he\n",

      "suffering because of deprivations which a Samana would not feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "He was open to everything, these people brought his way.  Welcome was\n",

      "the story of his poverty and who was not half as poor as any given\n",

      "the servant who shaved him and the street-vendor whom he let cheat him\n",
      "out of some small change when buying bananas.  When Kamaswami came to\n",
      "him, to complain about his worries or to reproach him concerning his\n",

      "to understand him, consented that he was a little bit right, only as\n",
      "much as he considered indispensable, and turned away from him, towards\n",
      "the next person who would ask for him.  And there were many who came to\n",
      "him, many to do business with him, many to cheat him, many to draw some\n",
      "secret out of him, many to appeal to his sympathy, many to get his\n",
      "advice.  He gave advice, he pitied, he made gifts, he let them cheat him\n",
      "a bit, and this entire game and the passion with which all people played\n",

      "At times he felt, deep in his chest, a dying, quiet voice, which\n",
      "admonished him quietly, lamented quietly; he hardly perceived it.  And\n",
      "then, for an hour, he became aware of the strange life he was leading,\n",
      "of him doing lots of things which were only a game, of, though being\n",
      "happy and feeling joy at times, real life still passing him by and not\n",
      "touching him.  As a ball-player plays with his balls, he played with\n",
      "his business-deals, with the people around him, watched them, found\n",
      "amusement in them; with his heart, with the source of his being, he was\n",
      "not with them.  The source ran somewhere, far away from him, ran and\n",
      "ran invisibly, had nothing to do with his life any more.  And at several\n",
      "times he suddenly became scared on account of such thoughts and wished\n",

      "his heart, really to live, really to act, really to enjoy and to live\n",
      "instead of just standing by as a spectator.  But again and again, he\n",
      "came back to beautiful Kamala, learned the art of love, practised the\n",
      "cult of lust, in which more than in anything else giving and taking\n",
      "becomes one, chatted with her, learned from her, gave her advice,\n",

      "\n",
      "Once, he said to her:  \"You are like me, you are different from most\n",

      "at home at yourself, as I can also do.  Few people have this, and yet\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Not all people are smart,\" said Kamala.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Siddhartha, \"that's not the reason why.  Kamaswami is just as\n",
      "smart as I, and still has no refuge in himself.  Others have it, who are\n",
      "small children with respect to their mind.  Most people, Kamala, are\n",
      "like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the\n",

      "like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in\n",
      "themselves they have their law and their course.  Among all the learned\n",
      "men and Samanas, of which I knew many, there was one of this kind, a\n",
      "perfected one, I'll never be able to forget him.  It is that Gotama,\n",
      "the exalted one, who is spreading that teachings.  Thousands of\n",
      "followers are listening to his teachings every day, follow his\n",

      "\n",
      "Siddhartha said nothing, and they played the game of love, one of the\n",
      "thirty or forty different games Kamala knew.  Her body was flexible\n",
      "like that of a jaguar and like the bow of a hunter; he who had learned\n",
      "from her how to make love, was knowledgeable of many forms of lust, many\n",
      "secrets.  For a long time, she played with Siddhartha, enticed him,\n",

      "\"It might very well be so,\" Siddhartha said tiredly.  \"I am like you.\n",

      "water and its secrets, so it seemed to him, would also understand many\n",
      "other things, many secrets, all secrets.\n",
      "\n",
      "But out of all secrets of the river, he today only saw one, this one\n",
      "touched his soul.  He saw: this water ran and ran, incessantly it ran,\n",
      "and was nevertheless always there, was always at all times the same\n",
      "and yet new in every moment!  Great be he who would grasp this,\n",
      "understand this!  He understood and grasped it not, only felt some idea\n",
      "of it stirring, a distant memory, divine voices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha rose, the workings of hunger in his body became unbearable.\n",
      "In a daze he walked on, up the path by the bank, upriver,\n",
      "listened to the current, listened to the rumbling hunger in his body.\n",
      "\n",
      "When he reached the ferry, the boat was just ready, and the same\n",
      "ferryman who had once transported the young Samana across the river,\n",
      "stood in the boat, Siddhartha recognised him, he had also aged very\n",
      "much.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Would you like to ferry me over?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ferryman, being astonished to see such an elegant man walking along\n",
      "and on foot, took him into his boat and pushed it off the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a beautiful life you have chosen for yourself,\" the passenger\n",
      "spoke.  \"It must be beautiful to live by this water every day and to\n",
      "cruise on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With a smile, the man at the oar moved from side to side:  \"It is\n",
      "beautiful, sir, it is as you say.  But isn't every life, isn't every\n",
      "work beautiful?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This may be true.  But I envy you for yours.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, you would soon stop enjoying it.  This is nothing for people\n",
      "wearing fine clothes.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha laughed.  \"Once before, I have been looked upon today because\n",
      "of my clothes, I have been looked upon with distrust.  Wouldn't you,\n",
      "ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me,\n",
      "from me?  For you must know, I have no money to pay your fare.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You're joking, sir,\" the ferryman laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not joking, friend.  Behold, once before you have ferried me across\n",
      "this water in your boat for the immaterial reward of a good deed.  Thus,\n",
      "do it today as well, and accept my clothes for it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you, sir, intent to continue travelling without clothes?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, most of all I wouldn't want to continue travelling at all.  Most of\n",
      "all I would like you, ferryman, to give me an old loincloth and kept me\n",
      "with you as your assistant, or rather as your trainee, for I'll have to\n",
      "learn first how to handle the boat.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, the ferryman looked at the stranger, searching.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I recognise you,\" he finally said.  \"At one time, you've slept in\n",
      "my hut, this was a long time ago, possibly more than twenty years ago,\n",
      "and you've been ferried across the river by me, and we parted like good\n",
      "friends.  Haven't you've been a Samana?  I can't think of your name any\n",
      "more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Siddhartha, and I was a Samana, when you've last seen me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So be welcome, Siddhartha.  My name is Vasudeva.  You will, so I hope,\n",
      "be my guest today as well and sleep in my hut, and tell me, where you're\n",
      "coming from and why these beautiful clothes are such a nuisance to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reached the middle of the river, and Vasudeva pushed the oar\n",
      "with more strength, in order to overcome the current.  He worked calmly,\n",
      "his eyes fixed in on the front of the boat, with brawny arms.\n",
      "Siddhartha sat and watched him, and remembered, how once before, on that\n",
      "last day of his time as a Samana, love for this man had stirred in his\n",
      "heart.  Gratefully, he accepted Vasudeva's invitation.  When they had\n",
      "reached the bank, he helped him to tie the boat to the stakes; after\n",
      "this, the ferryman asked him to enter the hut, offered him bread and\n",
      "water, and Siddhartha ate with eager pleasure, and also ate with eager\n",
      "pleasure of the mango fruits, Vasudeva offered him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, it was almost the time of the sunset, they sat on a log by\n",
      "the bank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman about where he originally\n",
      "came from and about his life, as he had seen it before his eyes today,\n",
      "in that hour of despair.  Until late at night, lasted his tale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva listened with great attention.  Listening carefully, he let\n",
      "everything enter his mind, birthplace and childhood, all that learning,\n",
      "all that searching, all joy, all distress.  This was among the\n",
      "ferryman's virtues one of the greatest:  like only a few, he knew how\n",
      "to listen.  Without him having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how\n",
      "Vasudeva let his words enter his mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he\n",
      "did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience,\n",
      "did not add his praise or rebuke, was just listening.  Siddhartha felt,\n",
      "what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to bury in\n",
      "his heart his own life, his own search, his own suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the end of Siddhartha's tale, when he spoke of the tree by the\n",
      "river, and of his deep fall, of the holy Om, and how he had felt such\n",
      "a love for the river after his slumber, the ferryman listened with twice\n",
      "the attention, entirely and completely absorbed by it, with his eyes\n",
      "closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Siddhartha fell silent, and a long silence had occurred, then\n",
      "Vasudeva said:  \"It is as I thought.  The river has spoken to you.  It\n",
      "is your friend as well, it speaks to you as well.  That is good, that is\n",
      "very good.  Stay with me, Siddhartha, my friend.  I used to have a wife,\n",
      "her bed was next to mine, but she has died a long time ago, for a long\n",
      "time, I have lived alone.  Now, you shall live with me, there is space\n",
      "and food for both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you,\" said Siddhartha, \"I thank you and accept.  And I also\n",
      "thank you for this, Vasudeva, for listening to me so well!  These people\n",
      "are rare who know how to listen.  And I did not meet a single one who\n",
      "knew it as well as you did.  I will also learn in this respect from\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will learn it,\" spoke Vasudeva, \"but not from me.  The river has\n",
      "taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well.  It knows\n",
      "everything, the river, everything can be learned from it.  See, you've\n",
      "already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive\n",
      "downwards, to sink, to seek depth.  The rich and elegant Siddhartha is\n",
      "becoming an oarsman's servant, the learned Brahman Siddhartha becomes a\n",
      "ferryman: this has also been told to you by the river.  You'll learn\n",
      "that other thing from it as well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha after a long pause:  \"What other thing, Vasudeva?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva rose.  \"It is late,\" he said, \"let's go to sleep.  I can't\n",
      "tell you that other thing, oh friend.  You'll learn it, or perhaps you\n",
      "know it already.  See, I'm no learned man, I have no special skill in\n",
      "speaking, I also have no special skill in thinking.  All I'm able to do\n",
      "is to listen and to be godly, I have learned nothing else.  If I was\n",
      "able to say and teach it, I might be a wise man, but like this I am only\n",
      "a ferryman, and it is my task to ferry people across the river.  I have\n",
      "transported many, thousands; and to all of them, my river has been\n",
      "nothing but an obstacle on their travels.  They travelled to seek money\n",
      "and business, and for weddings, and on pilgrimages, and the river was\n",
      "obstructing their path, and the ferryman's job was to get them quickly\n",
      "across that obstacle.  But for some among thousands, a few, four or\n",
      "five, the river has stopped being an obstacle, they have heard its\n",
      "voice, they have listened to it, and the river has become sacred to\n",
      "them, as it has become sacred to me.  Let's rest now, Siddhartha.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha stayed with the ferryman and learned to operate the boat, and\n",
      "when there was nothing to do at the ferry, he worked with Vasudeva in\n",
      "the rice-field, gathered wood, plucked the fruit off the banana-trees.\n",
      "He learned to build an oar, and learned to mend the boat, and to weave\n",
      "baskets, and was joyful because of everything he learned, and the days\n",
      "and months passed quickly.  But more than Vasudeva could teach him, he\n",
      "was taught by the river.  Incessantly, he learned from it.  Most of all,\n",
      "he learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart,\n",
      "with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without\n",
      "judgement, without an opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a friendly manner, he lived side by side with Vasudeva, and\n",
      "occasionally they exchanged some words, few and at length thought about\n",
      "words.  Vasudeva was no friend of words; rarely, Siddhartha succeeded\n",
      "in persuading him to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you,\" so he asked him at one time, \"did you too learn that secret\n",
      "from the river: that there is no time?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva's face was filled with a bright smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, Siddhartha,\" he spoke.  \"It is this what you mean, isn't it: that\n",
      "the river is everywhere at once, at the source and at the mouth, at the\n",
      "waterfall, at the ferry, at the rapids, in the sea, in the mountains,\n",
      "everywhere at once, and that there is only the present time for it, not\n",
      "the shadow of the past, not the shadow of the future?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This it is,\" said Siddhartha.  \"And when I had learned it, I looked at\n",
      "my life, and it was also a river, and the boy Siddhartha was only\n",
      "separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a\n",
      "shadow, not by something real.  Also, Siddhartha's previous births were\n",
      "no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future.  Nothing\n",
      "was, nothing will be; everything is, everything has existence and is\n",
      "present.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha spoke with ecstasy; deeply, this enlightenment had delighted\n",
      "him.  Oh, was not all suffering time, were not all forms of tormenting\n",
      "oneself and being afraid time, was not everything hard, everything\n",
      "hostile in the world gone and overcome as soon as one had overcome time,\n",
      "as soon as time would have been put out of existence by one's thoughts?\n",
      "In ecstatic delight, he had spoken, but Vasudeva smiled at him brightly\n",
      "and nodded in confirmation; silently he nodded, brushed his hand over\n",
      "Siddhartha's shoulder, turned back to his work.\n",
      "\n",
      "And once again, when the river had just increased its flow in the rainy\n",
      "season and made a powerful noise, then said Siddhartha:  \"Isn't it so,\n",
      "oh friend, the river has many voices, very many voices?  Hasn't it the\n",
      "voice of a king, and of a warrior, and of a bull, and of a bird of the\n",
      "night, and of a woman giving birth, and of a sighing man, and a thousand\n",
      "other voices more?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So it is,\" Vasudeva nodded, \"all voices of the creatures are in its\n",
      "voice.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And do you know,\" Siddhartha continued, \"what word it speaks, when you\n",
      "succeed in hearing all of its ten thousand voices at once?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Happily, Vasudeva's face was smiling, he bent over to Siddhartha and\n",
      "spoke the holy Om into his ear.  And this had been the very thing which\n",
      "Siddhartha had also been hearing.\n",
      "\n",
      "And time after time, his smile became more similar to the ferryman's,\n",
      "became almost just as bright, almost just as throughly glowing with\n",
      "bliss, just as shining out of thousand small wrinkles, just as alike to\n",
      "a child's, just as alike to an old man's.  Many travellers, seeing the\n",
      "two ferrymen, thought they were brothers.  Often, they sat in the\n",
      "evening together by the bank on the log, said nothing and both listened\n",
      "to the water, which was no water to them, but the voice of life, the\n",
      "voice of what exists, of what is eternally taking shape.  And it\n",
      "happened from time to time that both, when listening to the river,\n",
      "thought of the same things, of a conversation from the day before\n",
      "yesterday, of one of their travellers, the face and fate of whom had\n",
      "occupied their thoughts, of death, of their childhood, and that they\n",
      "both in the same moment, when the river had been saying something good\n",
      "to them, looked at each other, both thinking precisely the same thing,\n",
      "both delighted about the same answer to the same question.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was something about this ferry and the two ferrymen which was\n",
      "transmitted to others, which many of the travellers felt.  It happened\n",
      "occasionally that a traveller, after having looked at the face of one of\n",
      "the ferrymen, started to tell the story of his life, told about pains,\n",
      "confessed evil things, asked for comfort and advice.  It happened\n",
      "occasionally that someone asked for permission to stay for a night with\n",
      "them to listen to the river.  It also happened that curious people came,\n",
      "who had been told that there were two wise men, or sorcerers, or holy\n",
      "men living by that ferry.  The curious people asked many questions, but\n",
      "they got no answers, and they found neither sorcerers nor wise men, they\n",
      "only found two friendly little old men, who seemed to be mute and to\n",
      "have become a bit strange and gaga.  And the curious people laughed and\n",
      "were discussing how foolishly and gullibly the common people were\n",
      "spreading such empty rumours.\n",
      "\n",
      "The years passed by, and nobody counted them.  Then, at one time, monks\n",
      "came by on a pilgrimage, followers of Gotama, the Buddha, who were\n",
      "asking to be ferried across the river, and by them the ferrymen were\n",
      "told that they were most hurriedly walking back to their great\n",
      "teacher, for the news had spread the exalted one was deadly sick and\n",
      "would soon die his last human death, in order to become one with the\n",
      "salvation.  It was not long, until a new flock of monks came along on\n",
      "their pilgrimage, and another one, and the monks as well as most of the\n",
      "other travellers and people walking through the land spoke of nothing\n",
      "else than of Gotama and his impending death.  And as people are flocking\n",
      "from everywhere and from all sides, when they are going to war or to the\n",
      "coronation of a king, and are gathering like ants in droves, thus they\n",
      "flocked, like being drawn on by a magic spell, to where the great Buddha\n",
      "was awaiting his death, where the huge event was to take place and the\n",
      "great perfected one of an era was to become one with the glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, Siddhartha thought in those days of the dying wise man, the\n",
      "great teacher, whose voice had admonished nations and had awoken\n",
      "hundreds of thousands, whose voice he had also once heard, whose holy\n",
      "face he had also once seen with respect.  Kindly, he thought of him, saw\n",
      "his path to perfection before his eyes, and remembered with a smile\n",
      "those words which he had once, as a young man, said to him, the exalted\n",
      "one.  They had been, so it seemed to him, proud and precocious words;\n",
      "with a smile, he remembered them.  For a long time he knew that there\n",
      "was nothing standing between Gotama and him any more, though he was\n",
      "still unable to accept his teachings.  No, there was no teaching a\n",
      "truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept.\n",
      "But he who had found, he could approve of any teachings, every path,\n",
      "every goal, there was nothing standing between him and all the other\n",
      "thousand any more who lived in that what is eternal, who breathed what\n",
      "is divine.\n",
      "\n",
      "On one of these days, when so many went on a pilgrimage to the dying\n",
      "Buddha, Kamala also went to him, who used to be the most beautiful of\n",
      "the courtesans.  A long time ago, she had retired from her previous\n",
      "life, had given her garden to the monks of Gotama as a gift, had taken\n",
      "her refuge in the teachings, was among the friends and benefactors of\n",
      "the pilgrims.  Together with Siddhartha the boy, her son, she had gone\n",
      "on her way due to the news of the near death of Gotama, in simple\n",
      "clothes, on foot.  With her little son, she was travelling by the river;\n",
      "but the boy had soon grown tired, desired to go back home, desired to\n",
      "rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamala often had to take a rest with him, he was accustomed to having\n",
      "his way against her, she had to feed him, had to comfort him, had to\n",
      "scold him.  He did not comprehend why he had to go on this exhausting\n",
      "and sad pilgrimage with his mother, to an unknown place, to a stranger,\n",
      "who was holy and about to die.  So what if he died, how did this concern\n",
      "the boy?\n",
      "\n",
      "The pilgrims were getting close to Vasudeva's ferry, when little\n",
      "Siddhartha once again forced his mother to rest.  She, Kamala herself,\n",
      "had also become tired, and while the boy was chewing a banana, she\n",
      "crouched down on the ground, closed her eyes a bit, and rested.  But\n",
      "suddenly, she uttered a wailing scream, the boy looked at her in fear\n",
      "and saw her face having grown pale from horror; and from under her\n",
      "dress, a small, black snake fled, by which Kamala had been bitten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hurriedly, they now both ran along the path, in order to reach people,\n",
      "and got near to the ferry, there Kamala collapsed, and was not able to\n",
      "go any further.  But the boy started crying miserably, only interrupting\n",
      "it to kiss and hug his mother, and she also joined his loud screams for\n",
      "help, until the sound reached Vasudeva's ears, who stood at the ferry.\n",
      "Quickly, he came walking, took the woman on his arms, carried her into\n",
      "the boat, the boy ran along, and soon they all reached the hut, were\n",
      "Siddhartha stood by the stove and was just lighting the fire.  He looked\n",
      "up and first saw the boy's face, which wondrously reminded him of\n",
      "something, like a warning to remember something he had forgotten.  Then\n",
      "he saw Kamala, whom he instantly recognised, though she lay unconscious\n",
      "in the ferryman's arms, and now he knew that it was his own son, whose\n",

      "his chest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamala's wound was washed, but had already turned black and her body was\n",
      "swollen, she was made to drink a healing potion.  Her consciousness\n",

      "Siddhartha, who used to love her so much.  It seemed like a dream to\n",
      "her; with a smile, she looked at her friend's face; just slowly she,\n",
      "realized her situation, remembered the bite, called timidly for the boy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"He's with you, don't worry,\" said Siddhartha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kamala looked into his eyes.  She spoke with a heavy tongue, paralysed\n",
      "by the poison.  \"You've become old, my dear,\" she said, \"you've become\n",
      "gray.  But you are like the young Samana, who at one time came without\n",
      "clothes, with dusty feet, to me into the garden.  You are much more like\n",
      "him, than you were like him at that time when you had left me and\n",

      "At one time, when the boy's face reminded him very much of Kamala,\n",

      "love,\" she had said to him, and he had agreed with her and had compared\n",
      "himself with a star, while comparing the childlike people with falling\n",

      "Indeed, he had never been able to lose or devote himself completely to\n",
      "another person, to forget himself, to commit foolish acts for the love\n",
      "of another person; never he had been able to do this, and this was, as\n",
      "it had seemed to him at that time, the great distinction which set him\n",
      "apart from the childlike people.  But now, since his son was here, now\n",
      "he, Siddhartha, had also become completely a childlike person, suffering\n",
      "for the sake of another person, loving another person, lost to a love,\n",
      "having become a fool on account of love.  Now he too felt, late, once\n",
      "in his lifetime, this strongest and strangest of all passions, suffered\n",
      "from it, suffered miserably, and was nevertheless in bliss, was\n",
      "nevertheless renewed in one respect, enriched by one thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "He did sense very well that this love, this blind love for his son, was\n",
      "a passion, something very human, that it was Sansara, a murky source,\n",
      "dark waters.  Nevertheless, he felt at the same time, it was not\n",
      "worthless, it was necessary, came from the essence of his own being.\n",
      "This pleasure also had to be atoned for, this pain also had to be\n",
      "endured, these foolish acts also had to be committed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through all this, the son let him commit his foolish acts, let him\n",
      "court for his affection, let him humiliate himself every day by giving\n",
      "in to his moods.  This father had nothing which would have delighted\n",
      "him and nothing which he would have feared.  He was a good man, this\n",
      "father, a good, kind, soft man, perhaps a very devout man, perhaps a\n",
      "saint, all these there no attributes which could win the boy over.  He\n",

      "hut of his, he was bored by him, and for him to answer every naughtiness\n",
      "with a smile, every insult with friendliness, every viciousness with\n",
      "kindness, this very thing was the hated trick of this old sneak.  Much\n",
      "more the boy would have liked it if he had been threatened by him, if he\n",
      "had been abused by him.\n",
      "\n",
      "A day came, when what young Siddhartha had on his mind came bursting\n",
      "forth, and he openly turned against his father.  The latter had given\n",
      "him a task, he had told him to gather brushwood.  But the boy did not\n",
      "leave the hut, in stubborn disobedience and rage he stayed where he was,\n",
      "thumped on the ground with his feet, clenched his fists, and screamed in\n",
      "a powerful outburst his hatred and contempt into his father's face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Get the brushwood for yourself!\" he shouted foaming at the mouth, \"I'm\n",
      "not your servant.  I do know, that you won't hit me, you don't dare; I\n",
      "do know, that you constantly want to punish me and put me down with\n",
      "your religious devotion and your indulgence.  You want me to become like\n",
      "you, just as devout, just as soft, just as wise!  But I, listen up, just\n",

      "\n",
      "Rage and grief boiled over in him, foamed at the father in a hundred\n",

      "kept those copper and silver coins which they received as a fare.\n",
      "The boat had also disappeared, Siddhartha saw it lying by the opposite\n",
      "bank.  The boy had ran away.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I must follow him,\" said Siddhartha, who had been shivering with grief\n",
      "since those ranting speeches, the boy had made yesterday.  \"A child\n",
      "can't go through the forest all alone.  He'll perish.  We must build a\n",
      "raft, Vasudeva, to get over the water.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We will build a raft,\" said Vasudeva, \"to get our boat back, which the\n",
      "boy has taken away.  But him, you shall let run along, my friend, he is\n",
      "no child any more, he knows how to get around.  He's looking for the\n",
      "path to the city, and he is right, don't forget that.  He's doing what\n",
      "you've failed to do yourself.  He's taking care of himself, he's taking\n",
      "his course.  Alas, Siddhartha, I see you suffering, but you're suffering\n",
      "a pain at which one would like to laugh, at which you'll soon laugh for\n",
      "yourself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha did not answer.  He already held the axe in his hands and\n",
      "began to make a raft of bamboo, and Vasudeva helped him to tied the\n",
      "canes together with ropes of grass.  Then they crossed over, drifted\n",
      "far off their course, pulled the raft upriver on the opposite bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Why did you take the axe along?\" asked Siddhartha.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva said:  \"It might have been possible that the oar of our boat\n",
      "got lost.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "But Siddhartha knew what his friend was thinking.  He thought, the boy\n",
      "would have thrown away or broken the oar in order to get even and in\n",
      "order to keep them from following him.  And in fact, there was no oar\n",
      "left in the boat.  Vasudeva pointed to the bottom of the boat and looked\n",
      "at his friend with a smile, as if he wanted to say:  \"Don't you see what\n",
      "your son is trying to tell you?  Don't you see that he doesn't want to\n",
      "be followed?\"  But he did not say this in words.  He started making a\n",
      "new oar.  But Siddhartha bid his farewell, to look for the run-away.\n",
      "Vasudeva did not stop him.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Siddhartha had already been walking through the forest for a long\n",
      "time, the thought occurred to him that his search was useless.  Either,\n",
      "so he thought, the boy was far ahead and had already reached the city,\n",
      "or, if he should still be on his way, he would conceal himself from him,\n",
      "the pursuer.  As he continued thinking, he also found that he, on his\n",
      "part, was not worried for his son, that he knew deep inside that he had\n",
      "neither perished nor was in any danger in the forest.  Nevertheless, he\n",
      "ran without stopping, no longer to save him, just to satisfy his desire,\n",
      "just to perhaps see him one more time.  And he ran up to just outside of\n",
      "the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "When, near the city, he reached a wide road, he stopped, by the entrance\n",
      "of the beautiful pleasure-garden, which used to belong to Kamala, where\n",
      "he had seen her for the first time in her sedan-chair.  The past rose\n",
      "up in his soul, again he saw himself standing there, young, a bearded,\n",
      "naked Samana, the hair full of dust.  For a long time, Siddhartha stood\n",
      "there and looked through the open gate into the garden, seeing monks in\n",
      "yellow robes walking among the beautiful trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, he stood there, pondering, seeing images, listening to\n",
      "the story of his life.  For a long time, he stood there, looked at the\n",
      "monks, saw young Siddhartha in their place, saw young Kamala walking\n",
      "among the high trees.  Clearly, he saw himself being served food and\n",
      "drink by Kamala, receiving his first kiss from her, looking proudly and\n",
      "disdainfully back on his Brahmanism, beginning proudly and full of\n",

      "there is no other way for him who wants to teach.  But the world itself,\n",
      "what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided.  A person or\n",
      "an act is never entirely Sansara or entirely Nirvana, a person is never\n",

      "Maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a\n",
      "spirit in the cycle of transformations, therefore I also grant it\n",
      "importance.  Thus, I would perhaps have thought in the past.  But today\n",

      "also Buddha, I do not venerate and love it because it could turn into\n",
      "this or that, but rather because it is already and always everything--\n",
      "and it is this very fact, that it is a stone, that it appears to me now\n",
      "and today as a stone, this is why I love it and see worth and purpose in\n",
      "each of its veins and cavities, in the yellow, in the gray, in the\n",
      "hardness, in the sound it makes when I knock at it, in the dryness or\n",
      "wetness of its surface.  There are stones which feel like oil or soap,\n",
      "and others like leaves, others like sand, and every one is special and\n",
      "prays the Om in its own way, each one is Brahman, but simultaneously and\n",
      "just as much it is a stone, is oily or juicy, and this is this very fact\n",
      "which I like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship.--But let me\n",
      "speak no more of this.  The words are not good for the secret meaning,\n",
      "everything always becomes a bit different, as soon as it is put into\n",
      "words, gets distorted a bit, a bit silly--yes, and this is also very\n",

      "looking at and from which we can learn.  I can love a stone, Govinda,\n",
      "and also a tree or a piece of bark.  This are things, and things can be\n",

      "no taste, they have nothing but words.  Perhaps it are these which keep\n",
      "you from finding peace, perhaps it are the many words.  Because\n",
      "salvation and virtue as well, Sansara and Nirvana as well, are mere\n",
      "words, Govinda.  There is no thing which would be Nirvana; there is just\n",

      "you, my dear: I don't differentiate much between thoughts and words.\n",
      "To be honest, I also have no high opinion of thoughts.  I have a better\n",
      "opinion of things.  Here on this ferry-boat, for instance, a man has\n",
      "been my predecessor and teacher, a holy man, who has for many years\n",
      "simply believed in the river, nothing else.  He had noticed that the\n",

      "the river seemed to be a god to him, for many years he did not know that\n",
      "every wind, every cloud, every bird, every beetle was just as divine and\n",
      "knows just as much and can teach just as much as the worshipped river.\n",
      "But when this holy man went into the forests, he knew everything, knew\n",
      "more than you and me, without teachers, without books, only because he\n",
      "had believed in the river.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Govinda said:  \"But is that what you call `things', actually something\n",
      "real, something which has existence?  Isn't it just a deception of the\n",
      "Maja, just an image and illusion?  Your stone, your tree, your river--\n",
      "are they actually a reality?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This too,\" spoke Siddhartha, \"I do not care very much about.  Let the\n",
      "things be illusions or not, after all I would then also be an illusion,\n",
      "and thus they are always like me.  This is what makes them so dear and\n",
      "worthy of veneration for me: they are like me.  Therefore, I can love\n",
      "them.  And this is now a teaching you will laugh about: love, oh\n",

      "\n",
      "\"This I understand,\" spoke Govinda.  \"But this very thing was discovered\n",
      "by the exalted one to be a deception.  He commands benevolence,\n",
      "clemency, sympathy, tolerance, but not love; he forbade us to tie our\n",
      "heart in love to earthly things.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I know it,\" said Siddhartha; his smile shone golden.  \"I know it,\n",
      "Govinda.  And behold, with this we are right in the middle of the\n",
      "thicket of opinions, in the dispute about words.  For I cannot deny, my\n",
      "words of love are in a contradiction, a seeming contradiction with\n",
      "Gotama's words.  For this very reason, I distrust in words so much, for\n",
      "I know, this contradiction is a deception.  I know that I am in\n",
      "agreement with Gotama.  How should he not know love, he, who has\n",
      "discovered all elements of human existence in their transitoriness, in\n",
      "their meaninglessness, and yet loved people thus much, to use a long,\n",
      "laborious life only to help them, to teach them!  Even with him, even\n",
      "with your great teacher, I prefer the thing over the words, place more\n",
      "importance on his acts and life than on his speeches, more on the\n",
      "gestures of his hand than his opinions.  Not in his speech, not in his\n",
      "thoughts, I see his greatness, only in his actions, in his life.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a long time, the two old men said nothing.  Then spoke Govinda,\n",
      "while bowing for a farewell:  \"I thank you, Siddhartha, for telling me\n",
      "some of your thoughts.  They are partially strange thoughts, not all\n",
      "have been instantly understandable to me.  This being as it may, I thank\n",
      "you, and I wish you to have calm days.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "(But secretly he thought to himself:  This Siddhartha is a bizarre\n",
      "person, he expresses bizarre thoughts, his teachings sound foolish.\n",
      "So differently sound the exalted one's pure teachings, clearer, purer,\n",
      "more comprehensible, nothing strange, foolish, or silly is contained in\n",
      "them.  But different from his thoughts seemed to me Siddhartha's hands\n",
      "and feet, his eyes, his forehead, his breath, his smile, his greeting,\n",
      "his walk.  Never again, after our exalted Gotama has become one with the\n",
      "Nirvana, never since then have I met a person of whom I felt: this is a\n",

      "his teachings be strange, may his words sound foolish; out of his gaze\n",
      "and his hand, his skin and his hair, out of every part of him shines a\n",
      "purity, shines a calmness, shines a cheerfulness and mildness and\n",
      "holiness, which I have seen in no other person since the final death of\n",
      "our exalted teacher.)\n",
      "\n",
      "As Govinda thought like this, and there was a conflict in his heart, he\n",
      "once again bowed to Siddhartha, drawn by love.  Deeply he bowed to him\n",
      "who was calmly sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Siddhartha,\" he spoke, \"we have become old men.  It is unlikely for\n",
      "one of us to see the other again in this incarnation.  I see, beloved,\n",
      "that you have found peace.  I confess that I haven't found it.  Tell me,\n",
      "oh honourable one, one more word, give me something on my way which I\n",
      "can grasp, which I can understand!  Give me something to be with me on\n",
      "my path.  It is often hard, my path, often dark, Siddhartha.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha said nothing and looked at him with the ever unchanged,\n",
      "quiet smile.  Govinda stared at his face, with fear, with yearning,\n",
      "suffering, and the eternal search was visible in his look, eternal\n",
      "not-finding.\n",

      "But while Govinda with astonishment, and yet drawn by great love and\n",

      "imagine Nirvana and Sansara as one, while even a certain contempt for\n",

      "hundreds, of thousands, which all came and disappeared, and yet all\n",
      "seemed to be there simultaneously, which all constantly changed and\n",
      "renewed themselves, and which were still all Siddhartha.  He saw the\n",

      "face of a dying fish, with fading eyes--he saw the face of a new-born\n",
      "child, red and full of wrinkles, distorted from crying--he saw the face\n",
      "of a murderer, he saw him plunging a knife into the body of another\n",
      "person--he saw, in the same second, this criminal in bondage, kneeling\n",
      "and his head being chopped off by the executioner with one blow of his\n",
      "sword--he saw the bodies of men and women, naked in positions and cramps\n",
      "of frenzied love--he saw corpses stretched out, motionless, cold, void--\n",
      "he saw the heads of animals, of boars, of crocodiles, of elephants, of\n",
      "bulls, of birds--he saw gods, saw Krishna, saw Agni--he saw all of these\n",

      "having passed between the one and the other face--and all of these\n",
      "figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along\n",

      "impenetrable, perhaps benevolent, perhaps mocking, wise, thousand-fold\n",

      "me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those\n",
      "who seek knowledge.  They have a different goal; their goal is salvation\n",

      "clear, these so venerable teachings do not contain:  they do not contain\n",

      "alone among hundreds of thousands.  This is what I have thought and\n",
      "realized, when I have heard the teachings.  This is why I am continuing\n",

      "none, but to depart from all teachings and all teachers and to reach my\n",

      "it might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self\n",
      "would be calm and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and\n",
      "grow, for then I had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to\n",

      "of my self.\n",

      "stayed behind, where Govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this\n",
      "grove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him.  He pondered\n",
      "about this sensation, which filled him completely, as he was slowly\n",
      "walking along.  He pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he\n",
      "let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place\n",
      "where the causes lie, because to identify the causes, so it seemed to\n",
      "him, is the very essence of thinking, and by this alone sensations turn\n",
      "into realizations and are not lost, but become entities and start to\n",
      "emit like rays of light what is inside of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slowly walking along, Siddhartha pondered.  He realized that he was no\n",
      "youth any more, but had turned into a man.  He realized that one thing\n",
      "had left him, as a snake is left by its old skin, that one thing no\n",
      "longer existed in him, which had accompanied him throughout his youth\n",
      "and used to be a part of him: the wish to have teachers and to listen to\n",
      "teachings.  He had also left the last teacher who had appeared on his\n",
      "path, even him, the highest and wisest teacher, the most holy one,\n",
      "Buddha, he had left him, had to part with him, was not able to accept\n",
      "his teachings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Slower, he walked along in his thoughts and asked himself:  \"But what\n",
      "is this, what you have sought to learn from teachings and from teachers,\n",
      "and what they, who have taught you much, were still unable to teach\n",
      "you?\"  And he found:  \"It was the self, the purpose and essence of which\n",
      "I sought to learn.  It was the self, I wanted to free myself from, which\n",
      "I sought to overcome.  But I was not able to overcome it, could only\n",
      "deceive it, could only flee from it, only hide from it.  Truly, no\n",

      "Siddhartha!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Having been pondering while slowly walking along, he now stopped as\n",
      "these thoughts caught hold of him, and right away another thought sprang\n",
      "forth from these, a new thought, which was:  \"That I know nothing about\n",
      "myself, that Siddhartha has remained thus alien and unknown to me, stems\n",
      "from one cause, a single cause:  I was afraid of myself, I was fleeing\n",
      "from myself!  I searched Atman, I searched Brahman, I was willing to\n",
      "dissect my self and peel off all of its layers, to find the core of\n",
      "all peels in its unknown interior, the Atman, life, the divine part, the\n",

      "Siddhartha opened his eyes and looked around, a smile filled his face\n",

      "walked quickly like a man who knows what he has got to do.\n",

      "all this yellow and blue, river and forest, entered Siddhartha for the\n",
      "first time through the eyes, was no longer a spell of Mara, was no\n",
      "longer the veil of Maya, was no longer a pointless and coincidental\n",
      "diversity of mere appearances, despicable to the deeply thinking Brahman,\n",

      "and if also in the blue and the river, in Siddhartha, the singular and\n",
      "divine lived hidden, so it was still that very divinity's way and\n",
      "purpose, to be here yellow, here blue, there sky, there forest, and here\n",
      "Siddhartha.  The purpose and the essential properties were not somewhere\n",
      "behind the things, they were in them, in everything.\n",

      "\n",

      "river.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I than you, my benefactor,\" spoke Siddhartha, disembarking on the other\n",

      "\n",
      "\"I did see it,\" spoke the ferryman, \"and I haven't expected any payment\n",

      "timidly fled from the unknown Samana.  In the end of the village, the\n",
      "path led through a stream, and by the side of the stream, a young\n",
      "woman was kneeling and washing clothes.  When Siddhartha greeted her,\n",
      "she lifted her head and looked up to him with a smile, so that he saw\n",
      "the white in her eyes glistening.  He called out a blessing to her, as\n",
      "it is the custom among travellers, and asked how far he still had to go\n",
      "to reach the large city.  Then she got up and came to him, beautifully\n",
      "her wet mouth was shimmering in her young face.  She exchanged humorous\n",
      "banter with him, asked whether he had eaten already, and whether it was\n",
      "true that the Samanas slept alone in the forest at night and were not\n",
      "allowed to have any women with them.  While talking, she put her left\n",
      "foot on his right one and made a movement as a woman does who would want\n",
      "to initiate that kind of sexual pleasure with a man, which the textbooks\n",
      "call \"climbing a tree\".  Siddhartha felt his blood heating up, and since\n",
      "in this moment he had to think of his dream again, he bend slightly\n",
      "down to the woman and kissed with his lips the brown nipple of her\n",
      "breast.  Looking up, he saw her face smiling full of lust and her\n",

      "in this moment he heard, shuddering with awe, the voice if his innermost\n",
      "self, and this voice said No.  Then, all charms disappeared from the\n",

      "glance of a female animal in heat.  Politely, he petted her cheek,\n",
      "turned away from her and disappeared away from the disappointed woman\n",
      "with light steps into the bamboo-wood.\n",
      "\n",
      "On this day, he reached the large city before the evening, and was\n",
      "happy, for he felt the need to be among people.  For a long time, he\n",

      "Before the city, in a beautifully fenced grove, the traveller came\n",

      "baskets.  In their midst, carried by four servants in an ornamental\n",
      "sedan-chair, sat a woman, the mistress, on red pillows under a colourful\n",

      "watched the parade, saw the servants, the maids, the baskets, saw the\n",
      "sedan-chair and saw the lady in it.  Under black hair, which made to\n",
      "tower high on her head, he saw a very fair, very delicate, very smart\n",
      "face, a brightly red mouth, like a freshly cracked fig, eyebrows which\n",
      "were well tended and painted in a high arch, smart and watchful dark\n",

      "Siddhartha saw how beautiful she was, and his heart rejoiced.  He bowed\n",
      "deeply, when the sedan-chair came closer, and straightening up again,\n",
      "he looked at the fair, charming face, read for a moment in the smart\n",
      "eyes with the high arcs above, breathed in a slight fragrant, he did\n",
      "not know.  With a smile, the beautiful women nodded for a moment and\n",
      "disappeared into the grove, and then the servant as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus I am entering this city, Siddhartha thought, with a charming omen.\n",
      "He instantly felt drawn into the grove, but he thought about it, and\n",
      "only now he became aware of how the servants and maids had looked at him\n",
      "at the entrance, how despicable, how distrustful, how rejecting.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am still a Samana, he thought, I am still an ascetic and beggar.  I\n",
      "must not remain like this, I will not be able to enter the grove like\n",
      "this.  And he laughed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The next person who came along this path he asked about the grove and\n",
      "for the name of the woman, and was told that this was the grove of\n",
      "Kamala, the famous courtesan, and that, aside from the grove, she owned\n",
      "a house in the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, he entered the city.  Now he had a goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pursuing his goal, he allowed the city to suck him in, drifted through\n",
      "the flow of the streets, stood still on the squares, rested on the\n",
      "stairs of stone by the river.  When the evening came, he made friends\n",
      "with barber's assistant, whom he had seen working in the shade of an\n",
      "arch in a building, whom he found again praying in a temple of Vishnu,\n",
      "whom he told about stories of Vishnu and the Lakshmi.  Among the boats\n",
      "by the river, he slept this night, and early in the morning, before the\n",
      "first customers came into his shop, he had the barber's assistant shave\n",
      "his beard and cut his hair, comb his hair and anoint it with fine oil.\n",

      "received the courtesan's greeting.  But that servant who walked at the\n",
      "very end of her train he motioned to him and asked him to inform his\n",
      "mistress that a young Brahman would wish to talk to her.  After a while,\n",
      "the servant returned, asked him, who had been waiting, to follow him\n",
      "conducted him, who was following him, without a word into a pavilion,\n",

      "nothing, he waits, he thinks, he fasts, but he passes through the things\n",
      "of the world like a rock through water, without doing anything, without\n",
      "stirring; he is drawn, he lets himself fall.  His goal attracts him,\n",
      "because he doesn't let anything enter his soul which might oppose the\n",
      "goal.  This is what Siddhartha has learned among the Samanas.  This is\n",
      "what fools call magic and of which they think it would be effected by\n",
      "means of the daemons.  Nothing is effected by daemons, there are no\n",
      "daemons.  Everyone can perform magic, everyone can reach his goals, if\n",

      "Kamaswami entered, a swiftly, smoothly moving man with very gray hair,\n",
      "with very intelligent, cautious eyes, with a greedy mouth.  Politely,\n",

      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Siddhartha, \"I have not become destitute and have never been\n",

      "\n",
      "\"So you've lived of the possessions of others.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It is very good, sir.  When a person has nothing to eat, fasting is the\n",

      "learned to fast, he would have to accept any kind of service before this\n",
      "day is up, whether it may be with you or wherever, because hunger would\n",
      "force him to do so.  But like this, Siddhartha can wait calmly, he knows\n",
      "no impatience, he knows no emergency, for a long time he can allow\n",

      "of the body, however small it was, had its secret, which would bring\n",

      "without one admiring the other, without being just as defeated as they\n",
      "have been victorious, so that with none of them should start feeling\n",
      "fed up or bored and get that evil feeling of having abused or having\n",

      "children, joined in the celebration of a wedding, and returned extremely\n",
      "satisfied from his trip.  Kamaswami held against him that he had not\n",
      "turned back right away, that he had wasted time and money.  Siddhartha\n",
      "answered:  \"Stop scolding, dear friend!  Nothing was ever achieved by\n",
      "scolding.  If a loss has occurred, let me bear that loss.  I am very\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Surely,\" Siddhartha laughed, \"surely I have travelled for my amusement.\n",
      "For what else?  I have gotten to know people and places, I have received\n",
      "kindness and trust, I have found friendship.  Look, my dear, if I had\n",
      "been Kamaswami, I would have travelled back, being annoyed and in a\n",
      "hurry, as soon as I had seen that my purchase had been rendered\n",
      "impossible, and time and money would indeed have been lost.  But like\n",
      "this, I've had a few good days, I've learned, had joy, I've neither\n",
      "harmed myself nor others by annoyance and hastiness.  And if I'll ever\n",
      "return there again, perhaps to buy an upcoming harvest, or for whatever\n",
      "purpose it might be, friendly people will receive me in a friendly and\n",
      "happy manner, and I will praise myself for not showing any hurry and\n",
      "displeasure at that time.  So, leave it as it is, my friend, and don't\n",

      "a game without an ending?  Was it necessary to live for this?  No, it\n",
      "was not necessary!  The name of this game was Sansara, a game for\n",

      "himself, speaking which he had fallen asleep, and it seemed to him as if\n",

      "his eyes and looked at him, Siddhartha saw that Govinda did not\n",
      "recognise him.  Govinda was happy to find him awake; apparently, he had\n",

      "to wake you up, oh sir, and since I saw that your sleep was very deep,\n",
      "I stayed behind from my group and sat with you.  And then, so it seems,\n",
      "I have fallen asleep myself, I who wanted to guard your sleep.  Badly,\n",

      "tough against hunger.  With sadness, and yet also with a smile, he\n",

      "else.  And now, they had abandoned him, none of them was his any more,\n",
      "neither fasting, nor waiting, nor thinking.  For the most wretched\n",
      "things, he had given them up, for what fades most quickly, for sensual\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, he thought, since all these most easily perishing things have\n",
      "slipped from me again, now I'm standing here under the sun again just as\n",
      "I have been standing here a little child, nothing is mine, I have no\n",

      "already half gray, that my strength is fading, now I'm starting again\n",
      "at the beginning and as a child!  Again, he had to smile.  Yes, his fate\n",
      "had been strange!  Things were going downhill with him, and now he was\n",
      "again facing the world void and naked and stupid.  But he could not feed\n",

      "himself, to laugh about this strange, foolish world.\n",
      "\n",

      "a thousand eyes, the river looked at him, with green ones, with white\n",
      "ones, with crystal ones, with sky-blue ones.  How did he love this\n",
      "water, how did it delight him, how grateful was he to it!  In his heart\n",
      "he heard the voice talking, which was newly awaking, and it told him:\n",
      "Love this water!  Stay near it!  Learn from it!  Oh yes, he wanted to\n",
      "learn from it, he wanted to listen to it.  He who would understand this\n",

      "But out of all secrets of the river, he today only saw one, this one\n",

      "much.\n",

      "\n",
      "Siddhartha laughed.  \"Once before, I have been looked upon today because\n",
      "of my clothes, I have been looked upon with distrust.  Wouldn't you,\n",
      "ferryman, like to accept these clothes, which are a nuisance to me,\n",
      "from me?  For you must know, I have no money to pay your fare.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "all I would like you, ferryman, to give me an old loincloth and kept me\n",

      "\n",
      "For a long time, the ferryman looked at the stranger, searching.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now I recognise you,\" he finally said.  \"At one time, you've slept in\n",
      "my hut, this was a long time ago, possibly more than twenty years ago,\n",
      "and you've been ferried across the river by me, and we parted like good\n",
      "friends.  Haven't you've been a Samana?  I can't think of your name any\n",
      "more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"My name is Siddhartha, and I was a Samana, when you've last seen me.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So be welcome, Siddhartha.  My name is Vasudeva.  You will, so I hope,\n",
      "be my guest today as well and sleep in my hut, and tell me, where you're\n",
      "coming from and why these beautiful clothes are such a nuisance to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "They had reached the middle of the river, and Vasudeva pushed the oar\n",
      "with more strength, in order to overcome the current.  He worked calmly,\n",
      "his eyes fixed in on the front of the boat, with brawny arms.\n",
      "Siddhartha sat and watched him, and remembered, how once before, on that\n",
      "last day of his time as a Samana, love for this man had stirred in his\n",
      "heart.  Gratefully, he accepted Vasudeva's invitation.  When they had\n",
      "reached the bank, he helped him to tie the boat to the stakes; after\n",
      "this, the ferryman asked him to enter the hut, offered him bread and\n",
      "water, and Siddhartha ate with eager pleasure, and also ate with eager\n",
      "pleasure of the mango fruits, Vasudeva offered him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, it was almost the time of the sunset, they sat on a log by\n",
      "the bank, and Siddhartha told the ferryman about where he originally\n",
      "came from and about his life, as he had seen it before his eyes today,\n",
      "in that hour of despair.  Until late at night, lasted his tale.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva listened with great attention.  Listening carefully, he let\n",
      "everything enter his mind, birthplace and childhood, all that learning,\n",
      "all that searching, all joy, all distress.  This was among the\n",
      "ferryman's virtues one of the greatest:  like only a few, he knew how\n",
      "to listen.  Without him having spoken a word, the speaker sensed how\n",
      "Vasudeva let his words enter his mind, quiet, open, waiting, how he\n",
      "did not lose a single one, awaited not a single one with impatience,\n",
      "did not add his praise or rebuke, was just listening.  Siddhartha felt,\n",
      "what a happy fortune it is, to confess to such a listener, to bury in\n",
      "his heart his own life, his own search, his own suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the end of Siddhartha's tale, when he spoke of the tree by the\n",
      "river, and of his deep fall, of the holy Om, and how he had felt such\n",
      "a love for the river after his slumber, the ferryman listened with twice\n",
      "the attention, entirely and completely absorbed by it, with his eyes\n",
      "closed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But when Siddhartha fell silent, and a long silence had occurred, then\n",
      "Vasudeva said:  \"It is as I thought.  The river has spoken to you.  It\n",
      "is your friend as well, it speaks to you as well.  That is good, that is\n",
      "very good.  Stay with me, Siddhartha, my friend.  I used to have a wife,\n",
      "her bed was next to mine, but she has died a long time ago, for a long\n",
      "time, I have lived alone.  Now, you shall live with me, there is space\n",
      "and food for both.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thank you,\" said Siddhartha, \"I thank you and accept.  And I also\n",
      "thank you for this, Vasudeva, for listening to me so well!  These people\n",
      "are rare who know how to listen.  And I did not meet a single one who\n",
      "knew it as well as you did.  I will also learn in this respect from\n",
      "you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You will learn it,\" spoke Vasudeva, \"but not from me.  The river has\n",
      "taught me to listen, from it you will learn it as well.  It knows\n",
      "everything, the river, everything can be learned from it.  See, you've\n",
      "already learned this from the water too, that it is good to strive\n",
      "downwards, to sink, to seek depth.  The rich and elegant Siddhartha is\n",
      "becoming an oarsman's servant, the learned Brahman Siddhartha becomes a\n",
      "ferryman: this has also been told to you by the river.  You'll learn\n",
      "that other thing from it as well.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Quoth Siddhartha after a long pause:  \"What other thing, Vasudeva?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Vasudeva rose.  \"It is late,\" he said, \"let's go to sleep.  I can't\n",
      "tell you that other thing, oh friend.  You'll learn it, or perhaps you\n",
      "know it already.  See, I'm no learned man, I have no special skill in\n",
      "speaking, I also have no special skill in thinking.  All I'm able to do\n",
      "is to listen and to be godly, I have learned nothing else.  If I was\n",
      "able to say and teach it, I might be a wise man, but like this I am only\n",
      "a ferryman, and it is my task to ferry people across the river.  I have\n",
      "transported many, thousands; and to all of them, my river has been\n",
      "nothing but an obstacle on their travels.  They travelled to seek money\n",
      "and business, and for weddings, and on pilgrimages, and the river was\n",
      "obstructing their path, and the ferryman's job was to get them quickly\n",
      "across that obstacle.  But for some among thousands, a few, four or\n",
      "five, the river has stopped being an obstacle, they have heard its\n",
      "voice, they have listened to it, and the river has become sacred to\n",
      "them, as it has become sacred to me.  Let's rest now, Siddhartha.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Siddhartha stayed with the ferryman and learned to operate the boat, and\n",
      "when there was nothing to do at the ferry, he worked with Vasudeva in\n",
      "the rice-field, gathered wood, plucked the fruit off the banana-trees.\n",
      "He learned to build an oar, and learned to mend the boat, and to weave\n",
      "baskets, and was joyful because of everything he learned, and the days\n",
      "and months passed quickly.  But more than Vasudeva could teach him, he\n",
      "was taught by the river.  Incessantly, he learned from it.  Most of all,\n",
      "he learned from it to listen, to pay close attention with a quiet heart,\n",
      "with a waiting, opened soul, without passion, without a wish, without\n",
      "judgement, without an opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a friendly manner, he lived side by side with Vasudeva, and\n",
      "occasionally they exchanged some words, few and at length thought about\n",
      "words.  Vasudeva was no friend of words; rarely, Siddhartha succeeded\n",
      "in persuading him to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you,\" so he asked him at one time, \"did you too learn that secret\n",

      "separated from the man Siddhartha and from the old man Siddhartha by a\n",
      "shadow, not by something real.  Also, Siddhartha's previous births were\n",
      "no past, and his death and his return to Brahma was no future.  Nothing\n",

      "voice of a king, and of a warrior, and of a bull, and of a bird of the\n",
      "night, and of a woman giving birth, and of a sighing man, and a thousand\n",
      "other voices more?\"\n",

      "bliss, just as shining out of thousand small wrinkles, just as alike to\n",
      "a child's, just as alike to an old man's.  Many travellers, seeing the\n",

      "thought of the same things, of a conversation from the day before\n",
      "yesterday, of one of their travellers, the face and fate of whom had\n",
      "occupied their thoughts, of death, of their childhood, and that they\n",
      "both in the same moment, when the river had been saying something good\n",
      "to them, looked at each other, both thinking precisely the same thing,\n",

      "the ferrymen, started to tell the story of his life, told about pains,\n",
      "confessed evil things, asked for comfort and advice.  It happened\n",

      "one.  They had been, so it seemed to him, proud and precocious words;\n",
      "with a smile, he remembered them.  For a long time he knew that there\n",

      "just as white, just as quenched out, and saw at the same time his face\n",

      "this both being present and at the same time real, the feeling of\n",
      "eternity, completely filled every aspect of his being.  Deeply he felt,\n",

      "to sleep.  But Siddhartha went outside and sat this night before the\n",
      "hut, listening to the river, surrounded by the past, touched and\n",
      "encircled by all times of his life at the same time.  But occasionally,\n",
      "he rose, stepped to the door of the hut and listened, whether the boy\n",

      "\n",
      "Siddhartha spared him and let him do as he pleased, he honoured his\n",
      "mourning.  Siddhartha understood that his son did not know him, that\n",
      "he could not love him like a father.  Slowly, he also saw and understood\n",
      "that the eleven-year-old was a pampered boy, a mother's boy, and that he\n",
      "had grown up in the habits of rich people, accustomed to finer food, to\n",
      "a soft bed, accustomed to giving orders to servants.  Siddhartha\n",
      "understood that the mourning, pampered child could not suddenly and\n",
      "willingly be content with a life among strangers and in poverty.  He did\n",
      "not force him, he did many a chore for him, always picked the best piece\n",
      "of the meal for him.  Slowly, he hoped to win him over, by friendly\n",
      "patience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rich and happy, he had called himself, when the boy had come to him.\n",
      "Since time had passed on in the meantime, and the boy remained a\n",
      "stranger and in a gloomy disposition, since he displayed a proud and\n",
      "stubbornly disobedient heart, did not want to do any work, did not pay\n",
      "his respect to the old men, stole from Vasudeva's fruit-trees, then\n",
      "Siddhartha began to understand that his son had not brought him\n",
      "happiness and peace, but suffering and worry.  But he loved him, and he\n",
      "preferred the suffering and worries of love over happiness and joy\n",
      "without the boy.  Since young Siddhartha was in the hut, the old men had\n",
      "split the work.  Vasudeva had again taken on the job of the ferryman all\n",
      "by himself, and Siddhartha, in order to be with his son, did the work in\n",

      "\n",

      "understand him, to accept his love, to perhaps reciprocate it.  For\n",
      "long months, Vasudeva waited, watching, waited and said nothing.  One\n",
      "day, when Siddhartha the younger had once again tormented his father\n",
      "very much with spite and an unsteadiness in his wishes and had broken\n",
      "both of his rice-bowls, Vasudeva took in the evening his friend aside\n",
      "and talked to him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pardon me.\" he said, \"from a friendly heart, I'm talking to you.  I'm\n",

      "has not, like you, ran away from riches and the city, being disgusted\n",
      "and fed up with it; against his will, he had to leave all this behind.\n",
      "I asked the river, oh friend, many times I have asked it.  But the river\n",

      "what pain to endure?  Not a small one, his pain will be; after all, his\n",

      "For a long time, he stood there, pondering, seeing images, listening to\n",

      "among the high trees.  Clearly, he saw himself being served food and\n",
      "drink by Kamala, receiving his first kiss from her, looking proudly and\n",
      "disdainfully back on his Brahmanism, beginning proudly and full of\n",
      "desire his worldly life.  He saw Kamaswami, saw the servants, the\n",

      "not been given to him in order to turn the knife in it, that it had to\n",
      "become a blossom and had to shine.\n",
      "\n",
      "That this wound did not blossom yet, did not shine yet, at this hour,\n",

      "more, no goal.  He sat lost in thought and waited.  This he had learned\n",
      "by the river, this one thing: waiting, having patience, listening\n",
      "attentively.  And he sat and listened, in the dust of the road, listened\n",
      "to his heart, beating tiredly and sadly, waited for a voice.  Many an\n",
      "hour he crouched, listening, saw no images any more, fell into\n",
      "emptiness, let himself fall, without seeing a path.  And when he felt\n",
      "the wound burning, he silently spoke the Om, filled himself with Om.\n",
      "The monks in the garden saw him, and since he crouched for many hours,\n",
      "and dust was gathering on his gray hair, one of them came to him and\n",
      "placed two bananas in front of him.  The old man did not see him.\n",
      "\n",
      "From this petrified state, he was awoken by a hand touching his\n",
      "shoulder.  Instantly, he recognised this touch, this tender, bashful\n",
      "touch, and regained his senses.  He rose and greeted Vasudeva, who had\n",
      "followed him.  And when he looked into Vasudeva's friendly face, into\n",
      "the small wrinkles, which were as if they were filled with nothing but\n",
      "his smile, into the happy eyes, then he smiled too.  Now he saw the\n",
      "bananas lying in front of him, picked them up, gave one to the ferryman,\n",
      "ate the other one himself.  After this, he silently went back into the\n",
      "forest with Vasudeva, returned home to the ferry.  Neither one talked\n",
      "about what had happened today, neither one mentioned the boy's name,\n",
      "neither one spoke about him running away, neither one spoke about the\n",

      "brothers, their vanities, desires for possession, and ridiculous aspects\n",
      "were no longer ridiculous to him, became understandable, became lovable,\n",
      "even became worthy of veneration to him.  The blind love of a mother\n",

      "of happy fathers, of his knowledge of the foolishness of such wishes, of\n",

      "who was regarded as a wise man by many.  When Govinda went back on his\n",

      "because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search,\n",
      "because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal.  Searching\n",
      "means: having a goal.  But finding means: being free, being open, having\n",
      "no goal.  You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because,\n",

      "all, I have learned here from this river and from my predecessor, the\n",
      "ferryman Vasudeva.  He was a very simple person, Vasudeva, he was no\n",

      "\n",

      "knowledge in me, as one would feel life in one's heart.  There have\n",
      "been many thoughts, but it would be hard for me to convey them to you.\n",
      "Look, my dear Govinda, this is one of my thoughts, which I have found:\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Are you kidding?\" asked Govinda.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm not kidding.  I'm telling you what I've found.  Knowledge can be\n",
      "conveyed, but not wisdom.  It can be found, it can be lived, it is\n",
      "possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it\n",
      "cannot be expressed in words and taught.  This was what I, even as a\n",
      "young man, sometimes suspected, what has driven me away from the\n",
      "teachers.  I have found a thought, Govinda, which you'll again regard as\n",
      "a joke or foolishness, but which is my best thought.  It says:  The\n",
      "opposite of every truth is just as true!  That's like this: any truth\n",
      "can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided.\n",
      "Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with\n",
      "words, it's all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness,\n",
      "roundness, oneness.  When the exalted Gotama spoke in his teachings of\n",
      "the world, he had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into deception\n",
      "and truth, into suffering and salvation.  It cannot be done differently,\n",
      "there is no other way for him who wants to teach.  But the world itself,\n",
      "what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided.  A person or\n",
      "an act is never entirely Sansara or entirely Nirvana, a person is never\n",
      "entirely holy or entirely sinful.  It does really seem like this,\n",
      "because we are subject to deception, as if time was something real.\n",
      "Time is not real, Govinda, I have experienced this often and often\n",
      "again.  And if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between\n",
      "the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between\n",
      "evil and good, is also a deception.\"\n",

      "will reach the Nirvana, will be Buddha--and now see: these 'times to\n",
      "come' are a deception, are only a parable!  The sinner is not on his\n",
      "way to become a Buddha, he is not in the process of developing, though\n",
      "our capacity for thinking does not know how else to picture these\n",
      "things.  No, within the sinner is now and today already the future\n",
      "Buddha, his future is already all there, you have to worship in him, in\n",
      "you, in everyone the Buddha which is coming into being, the possible,\n",
      "the hidden Buddha.  The world, my friend Govinda, is not imperfect, or\n",
      "on a slow path towards perfection: no, it is perfect in every moment,\n",
      "all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself, all small\n",

      "is, and will be as if it was simultaneous, and there everything is\n",
      "good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman.  Therefore, I see\n",

      "requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be\n",
      "good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever\n",
      "harm me.  I have experienced on my body and on my soul that I needed sin\n",
      "very much, I needed lust, the desire for possessions, vanity, and needed\n",
      "the most shameful despair, in order to learn how to give up all\n",
      "resistance, in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop\n",
      "comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection\n",

      "Maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a\n",
      "spirit in the cycle of transformations, therefore I also grant it\n",
      "importance.  Thus, I would perhaps have thought in the past.  But today\n",
      "I think: this stone is a stone, it is also animal, it is also god, it is\n",
      "also Buddha, I do not venerate and love it because it could turn into\n",
      "this or that, but rather because it is already and always everything--\n",
      "and it is this very fact, that it is a stone, that it appears to me now\n",
      "and today as a stone, this is why I love it and see worth and purpose in\n",
      "each of its veins and cavities, in the yellow, in the gray, in the\n",
      "hardness, in the sound it makes when I knock at it, in the dryness or\n",
      "wetness of its surface.  There are stones which feel like oil or soap,\n",
      "and others like leaves, others like sand, and every one is special and\n",
      "prays the Om in its own way, each one is Brahman, but simultaneously and\n",
      "just as much it is a stone, is oily or juicy, and this is this very fact\n",
      "which I like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship.--But let me\n",
      "speak no more of this.  The words are not good for the secret meaning,\n",
      "everything always becomes a bit different, as soon as it is put into\n",
      "words, gets distorted a bit, a bit silly--yes, and this is also very\n",
      "good, and I like it a lot, I also very much agree with this, that this\n",

      "and also a tree or a piece of bark.  This are things, and things can be\n",

      "no taste, they have nothing but words.  Perhaps it are these which keep\n",
      "you from finding peace, perhaps it are the many words.  Because\n",
      "salvation and virtue as well, Sansara and Nirvana as well, are mere\n",
